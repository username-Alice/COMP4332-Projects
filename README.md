This repo includes all the Data Mining Projects I worked in COMP4332 at HKUST

Project 1
This project aims to predict the sentiment score over a set of reviews. The reviews are 
mostly about the content of movies or the dvd/blu-rays they purchased. This report 
aims to explain the attempts we made to build our model for this task. 

Project 2
This project aims to predict the link existence between users given their user ids. This 
report details the approaches and techniques, specifically DeepWalk and Node2Vec, 
employed to build a model for this link prediction task. 

Project 3
This project aims to perform rating prediction for the products given their reviewer ids 
and  product  ids.  This  report  details  the  approaches  and  techniques,  specifically 
Collaborative  Filtering  based  Recommendation  and  Wide  &  Deep  Learning, 
employed to build a model for this rating prediction task.
