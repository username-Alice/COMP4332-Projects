A3EMGD8RAEOK64_2907,"On our trip this past summer to Lunenberg, Nova Scotia, I found out that this movie was filmed in that town."
A2BOWU2PX28BET_5501,"Excellent!! Most remakes fall short of the original which in this case was also excellent. This is a chilling story, an excellent cast."
A100WO06OQR8BQ_10469,I started to watch this movie but it is such a lousy movie that I had to stop watching. That was a surprise because I usually like De Niro movies.
A2H4LKU7CPIUU9_11364,Well! I must be terribly jaded. Or I am completely polluted by today's wayward society and it's lack of morality because I found this film.....boring. This is serious. I need to see someone about this.
A14RF11JYGDKI8_23751,Dark and grim -- not a fun movie.  Watch it for the performances and the pathos...
A1ZWWLQFDTP5TE_2549,Julie Walters and Michael Caine are terrific. This is one of my favorite movies; funny and entertaining movie showing the education of Rita and the Professor!
A3SHAC3GVMHPWD_23491,"Zero plot; nothing but fetish glorification and even that wasn't stimulating in any way.  Oh, and the horrible ending that just left you disgusted with the whole thing.  Wasted time I will never get back."
A2EP4PMBS78D5F_4608,"Came as expected, easily opened. My kids n I love this movie it's great to have it on dvd .."
A1RLNWIN74WBZW_16258,"Good action movie.  However, in my opinion it had a major plot hole.  What did the creature feed on until explorers infrequently came along?"
A371EYWDGHVSAK_3411,i just love this tape so must it is great i just love to watch it thank you so must
A4ZTK81NUSDH1_18531,This fun old fashioned movie taken from the 1950's TV show takes us back to a simpler time when viewers expectations were far less demanding than today.
A2M2UBFKZKC8OI_7238,Lots of new insight into Chaplin's life I never knew about before.  Well worth seeing whether you are a silent film fan or not.
A38BJJX22XP7SP_10427,Really good - action packed - and the story was well told.  De Niro is really good.
A2X1G6S60ULIYJ_22259,this is a good movie. i loved it when i was a kid but it made me kind of gloomy afterward. still glad i own it
A23MJLDET986F7_5966,Johnny Depo can master any characters mind that he puts his own into! This is one of my favorite movies he has acted in!
A6EKCSZ2XWDGV_21867,"I usually watch these videos many times - this one I had to cut short. Nice to have for collecting reasons,,,but a waste of money. The PBS film on Dylan is wonderful."
A3SCJISB4IZL79_18595,"Gosh, I would expect some special features with a blu-ray release but according to the info above it has nothing.
  What a disappointment."
A1RHP6PX9UPJ3E_12831,Very funny movie  & I thought they were going to make a 2nd one but I guess they figured 1 was enough
A3MH99KJ4SWVKB_18770,"The acting may be terrible but the storyline is still a classic. It is worth watching until the end. Enjoy being a child again for just a little while,"
A1BBBIN5NMNPV7_58,I enjoyed this movie because it was much easier to relate to than the original English classic version.  I had watched parts of it on TV many years ago.
A1PQ1PESSO8CMO_5823,I got this for my daughter and we both really enjoyed it! It's a cute movie and has some funny parts.
AVCTILIAWIFIJ_21276,"I love this movie, but the sound was off from the visual. Not my player, as other movies are fine."
A3FTR9MZ8HJ740_9650,"Great movie and wonderful music, but after watching it after several years of not seeing it, I realized that some of the acting wasn't very good. But still a classic"
A28E9N78YH8XLG_21375,"Odd little movie.  Expected to see more of the incredible scenery of the Chiricahua Mountains where this movie was filmed.  If you love Johnny Depp, you will enjoy this one!"
A1S5ZQ61RFCSOE_12398,"I can sum this movie up in one word ""CRAP""

Worst Samurai film I have ever seen. If you like Kurasawa stick with him. This ones worth avoiding."
A8F27NVA2ARO7_5745,Another great John Hughes movie. I absolutely love his movies. I've been watching the Breakfast Club since I was little. Its a great movie I love it.
A3O5T5VAQ3TD17_19298,"I just got threw watching this movie.  It was boring from beginning to end.  There wasn't a whole lot of good scene's in this movie, the only decent scene was at the beginning..."
A3IP5IWF3496D2_7315,Up graded from DVD. It is a bit too bright on the opening credits. Other than that. the film looks better than the DVD.
A33ZPRGHUHMBPP_11692,"Although not nearly so fine as the earlier British version, Heston is very good.  The temptation to sentimentality is not totally avoided in the script, but the actors are pleasing and the film is entertaining."
A3GEX2Z363SNGE_18414,"This movie s[stunk]!!!!!! It is a complete rip-off from the original and worst of all there is no plot except for big giant Alligator that terrorizes this city. see the original, don't waste your time with #2."
AEESRZ0CZ1R4J_5708,"A must see classic from the 80's, great characters and relationships between unlikely pairs.  Everyone can identify with one of the characters (or at least parts of the character)."
A2UPKPG5OBNCAZ_10396,The plot was not very interesting; the movie plodded along.  Much better spy/assassin movies out there.
A2AFJD7X0EII41_15964,"For a Blu-ray transfer the audio is really bad, I had to add extra Bass to get the music to sound the way is suppose to"
A9BN9L8T4JS59_14315,just like any other war movie but i wanted to see a nuke go off
AWW7RK5GG9TFY_21820,"I really like Meg Ryan, but I had this movie on for awhile and just couldn't stay interested in it so didn't watch the whole movie. Rather slow moving."
AV4H59BHCWJ89_4471,good just not as good as Priscilla Queen of the desert this is an American version
A2DNMDHGAT6JZW_10571,"It's a movie that you have watch, I lost interest so I did not watch it to the end so I don't know."
A10B1UKRYSK9K2_21227,Fun 80's Mockumentary with some good laughs.  Light hearted and fun just don't expect too much.
AM68L114XLCD_11028,"I just didn't care too much for the video. The POWER OF INTENTION puts this to shame. Sorry, wish I had found it more interesting."
A2ONLDB3HCV1K2_3310,finally got around to seeing this movie after so many people told me about it and I love it Mel Brooks is a comedy genius
A26UHHSKOOV8LT_19202,"I rated it only 2 stars simply because it more a reality show than a sci-fi, which was what I  was hunting for."
AHNYNRS4JF1R8_20741,"I like the concept of a big multi-generational Russian epic, but the result is disjointed and not always easy to follow. There is, however, some excellent acting."
A1NGY22FQPWGQF_12241,I saw this film on Mystery Science Theater 3000 the movie and it was funny. I wish they would re-release that. this dvd by itself is not cool.
A1AGA3FF8VQNO4_2376,"Love this movie. The movie is sort of a 30s-40s futuristic sci-fi, it's a thinker film. No laser fights or explosions. Dream big even when - genetically you don't count."
A08161909WK3HU7UYTMW_11956,"i want get the set with south pacific  and oklahoma and others.
please accept my apology for not getting this dvd.

respectfully

Jody colllyer"
A2HD6ZM35XFAG1_17245,"The movie did have some funny parts, but was not up to Mel Brooks standards.  Young Frankenstein, it was not.  Not a movie for children under 18.  Simply one of those movies where great talent was wasted."
A1VXO8FQ4GAFUO_3634,I loved this movie from beginning to end. I probably will watch it again on Amazon prime. A story that provides a surprise at every turn but that does not disappoint. I recommend it.
AVTMYIRSYF8BK_4641,I found this movie full of interesting points of view. A very difficult case for that time. I liked the ending
A1U4BI131GH3KW_19222,The show is captivating and fully entertaining.  Appeals to those who enjoy a good scare . As well as to those who enjoy learning fun and interesting new things
A2VPMQMW2JB8ZX_4840,This is the basic Patsy Cline story. It is a good story with a good cast.
A2EI4T5YBKF6G4_22706,It was beyond B as a film. I laughed all the way through it. I watched it because Stacy and Micheal dorn were in it. Then it was like a train. Wreck. I could not look away. Lol
A1UEKWP21I624H_1951,"Great movie for my four and seven year old girls.  Excitement, drama, kid-centric - they've enjoyed watching it."
A10ARFGFWMVO9G_21394,"clearly the dvd was made on an Apple media editor (note the logo in the main menu).

looks to be half heartily restored by a bunch of people.

you would be better of buying the VCI version."
A3U5Q0QAA49ZFQ_5815,"One of the best family movies of all times! This is one of the few movies that my husband, daughter, and I all enjoy watching. As a bonus it comes with the second movie."
A6AX9RJ43B55M_11165,"Not terribly impressed, probably because I've heard so much about it over the years.  Now I can stop wondering."
A2CR2DIH9LNGBM_4275,"This was a fairly good movie.  Special effects were weak, but a good story line."
A37BTU85F17716_6601,Bought this film because it's an Academy Award winner for Best Picture of 1999. Had to add it to my collection.
A1FWX3EKB70QES_20991,"Odessa File has some good points but these hardly compensate for the character and plot lapses. It simply doesn't hold up as well as other, similar movies from the 70s, Day of the Jackal in particular. Three stars, just."
A329UBPT73PAMZ_20530,Not as good as I would have hoped.  The storyline was too long and drawn out.
A1LKQT9TJLU1OA_15662,Too bad there isn't a zero rating. That's what it's worth. My husband and I both thought it was one of the worst sci-fi (or whatever category you want to put it in) movies ever. Very dumb ending!
A1BL1H27IHLOQX_21050,I was hoping this would be an entertaining movie but gave up on it quickly.  Rube Goldberg gate opening sequence was just too stupid.
ANYLQYR2FFJ4_653,2 of the most beautiful people on the planet along with an interesting story - what more can you ask for.  When I'm searching for a new film I'll often say something like 'No Mercy' or 'Basic Instinct'.
A2YD0YKPG1T80S_7169,For some reason I enjoyed watching this suspense movie. The actors make it a better movie.  I think Kevin Bacon is a great actor and this shows quite a range.
A1HY330AC7XUCC_19715,I love Robin Williams but I lost interest half way through this movie.  I just didn't enjoy it at all.  Sorry.  :(
A3MCEFHHX3IXJ5_7622,"Even my husband and I like to re-watch this set of classic golden films.  In fact, we did so last weekend!"
AEYKB0I8IJPRR_22346,"Great film. Mediocre DVD pan & scan, which is disastrous for a film as beautifully framed and photographed (in 2.35:1 widescreen!) as this one is."
AK5YUL13JKBM_2957,What a funny movie along with martin Lawrence and with the others who stared in this very funny movie. The DVD Arrived just as it was scheduled to arrived.....
AAK377MAKWL62_1243,Maybe this film just doesn't age well. Or maybe it's just not very good. One star is too high.
A1Z2WCGRP49DF8_16070,"This animated film hasn't been seen in years, but for many kids growing up in the 60's. it just wasn't Christmas without this surprisingly well done production."
AN6I05GKPKW6U_5752,"Great classic coming of age movie.  The stars, Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy, all gave great performances.  These stars all went on the have long acting careers."
A1D00GEXOG8FXR_10127,How great can it be without Sellers?  But still worth the effort to see the other actors from his earlier movies.
AZVA13Q19KURR_21097,I saw this movie in the theatre when I was 12.  I'm now 30.  I still remember it as the worst movie I ever saw.  Ever.  (Raising Cain is #2 and Van Helsing is #3.)
ADOAIHJFM1XDN_16129,"Awesome old school Romero movie with the magic of Tom Savini.
The gore-factor is off the charts and I was thrilled to put this film back in my collection."
AJR36DM1191VQ_22207,Give this a watch if you like being both confused and depressed at the end of a movie.
A132YPUAH1S0XV_18451,"Boring, predictable, trite.  Harrison Ford is not at his best here--this is not the role for him.  Annette Bening turns in some very credible acting, but it is not enough to save this dreadful film."
A2OP6GAWTLEF5S_4656,United States historical event everyone should know. Ridding our country of slavery was a complex process and this movie documents one step in the process.
AJFCV3KG7FMVH_21739,"Don't waste your money, it was outrageous and very boring. I ended up putting the DVD in the bin. It was shame as I was looking forward to this movie."
A3EBQZN7ZJYF8E_18600,It is okay. I would have appreciated captions. Disappointed in the production. The one I saw in Seattle years ago was better.
A2SP52NH44LRDS_11523,"Don't waste your time with this Australian B-rated movie.

PROS: Girl who plays the girlfriend is cute.

CONS: stupid zombie movie, not scary, gross

I'd recommend the scariest movie ever called AUDITION which is a Japanese movie with subtitles."
A2UTZZZHY6LNC8_924,"Amazing, life changing the first time I saw it.  One of my favorite Spielberg movies"
A2LLP61JZEEAIU_19384,It wasn't much of a story but of course that wasn't why I watched the movie. There was enough plot and nudity to keep me interested to finish the movie. Its worth seeing once.
A2HQ4F42L9O7XI_11756,"Although the special effects were limited, this was another fine concept by the Creator of the original Star Trek. Yes, some concepts seem a bit, hammy, but overall this was a good movie with some interesting concepts."
A2OI4QVY88HBH2_10420,Overall the movie has a weak plot but it has DeNiro. So I gave it an extra star.
A1UF8AQYE6TMGH_19415,"Aimlessly wandering story of heritage denial.  It would have been more meaningful as a short.  Character Nicholson played later appeared in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, or so it seems."
A352H2KJM3ET9H_7751,Also had this in VHS.  Julia is just as pretty on DVD.  This is an update to some of my old VHS movies.
AJOE61SITTESJ_5770,great movie love the song on it and the 80s are go movies in them great price on it to
A39E7OURBJ3GY7_5692,"The blu-ray was shipped quickly and in very good condition, I didn't remember what the movie was all about until I started watching it."
A1QGGYMSJY9W4O_23153,Super old film about killer food aha. Definitely isn't everyone cup of tea. It however is a cool flash back of a childhood classic when movies were original and had makeup and no effects.
ATFWU4WSZ38BF_21186,was so choppy had a hard time keeping the story line straight.  So not my choice.  I am sure kids enjoy it.  Just didn't have any with me that day  :  )
A2FHM6DSCFOABL_23310,"The story line is old, corny and hard to watch. I wanted to see more of the old film stars and less of the hammy acting."
AJ09ITQVXNXRL_7189,"I found this workout fun, energizing and it has great music.  It's also great for all different fitness levels.  It's interval training so you just add heavier weights as your level increases.  I highly recommend this one."
A357PR36ZKWF4Z_23896,"Won't play, not on a Toshiba, nor on a Samsung, or in an LG PC Blu-Ray and HD DVD reader.  Since I bought several movies, and since I did not view several in time to squawk, I am stuck."
ATCZN8BVKGQ7Q_17487,"This looks like a very bad copy from VHS, the picture fuzzy and shakes while the audio is very low. Will return and not re-order."
AYFVRNZIVH1HB_8733,Excellent story of the ridiculous coverup of the murder of a president and the repercussions if you question it.
AS5ZYSQTL9UGR_7902,The package of the four movies I bought arrived really early! Awesome. I mostly got this for my little sister. She completely forgot about this movie. P:
A1ONLNA4KGV3ZC_8121,One of the contemporary Disney films that can still teach a lesson to its viewers. Absolutely a film to recommend.
A37JRXSEQ4DLK5_3281,"I'm a big Mel Brooks fan and also a Leslie Nielsen fan.. I highly recommend watching this movie if your into comedy movies like Spaceballs/Young Frankenstein and other movies like that then this will be right down your alley

-B"
A24DA50H1AQGQN_5230,"You got to love those 18 wheelers. Yes, Meatloaf of all people, Patrick was a very good actor and of course Randy Travis is rare and raw in this one. I enjoyed it."
A2XBLMW3MJF9NC_7627,This is a good movie for all ages and is one for the ages. A recommended movie for your collection.
AAHZ3X2GLX171_19136,"This is from the MGM vault series. While it is not close-captioned for the hearing-impaired, it is presented (for the first time on DVD) in its original (theatrical) letter-boxed presentation of 1:85."
AWBXMV731DE8U_11712,"Ridiculous, riddled with assumptions presented as fact.
Quantum Physics is fascinating, but this attempt to meld it with religion is short-sighted and new-agey."
A1HI0WDHZB4WE1_17348,"Contacted amazon prior to purchasing to make sure I was getting one that would play on my player, the dvd that came would not play, since I didn't keep my receipt I could not return."
A2WAKV0HLPVIQS_15456,"peter sellers is the man very zany movie typical 60s movie, it has its moments just not enough of them but sellers is so funny it overcomes the bad scenes"
A34Y3IZH8GVYMO_1919,one of the best movies both actors have done.  I had this in vcr and wanted to update it to dvd as I enjoy watching it again and again.
A1USCSLRVAP0D1_9205,"Who doesn't love this movie?  It is phenomenal; I don't need to tell you that.  I loved the extensive making of and all the interesting facts and the trials behind making the film.

Worth the bucks."
A2HWMV7ATIXLRB_960,nice paging  and nice to see old things look new and stylish.  Brings back my childhood.  Worth the money.  good deal
A1LS637NUN2IAX_22692,"I guess I forgot how low my taste in humor was back then.  This is no Animal House, but it was interesting to see Kurt Russell stretching his humor skills.  Way too many F Bombs."
ABZWJ944HL5LS_19566,Lots of big name actors in the movie. As long as you are jaded to crude comments and immoral conduct you will find it entertaining.
A2JGO1MOFL1OJU_10448,Good stars but plot was thin and predictable and chase scenes looked like I had filmed them.
A2P5SRLMQXS759_854,One of the best movies ever made! The characters evolve through several years but the love and friendship never fails.
AQ542Q2BCBR8S_5892,Hadn't watched this in awhile. Great movie (not as good as the book but still good.) Shipped quickly and arrived as expected.
A2QWHC6G91IDJA_8861,I got it as a gift for a friend. Shipping was fast and DVD arrived exactly as described. I enjoyed watching it too.
A3IY9I5AESTHU8_12726,Loved all of the old Star Trek movies and TV series. This one was my lease favorite but it is still really good.
A268PS668GOQBG_22267,racist against white people! i hated this film densel washington and spike lee praised this film! i hope this film never makes it 2 dvd!
A2ZLR3PG0243GM_16462,A very nice early effort from a group of people who have gone on to bigger and better things.
AG91TFMTVDNP2_20642,"Somebody bought this illegally on my account.  Might be a good movie,  but I doubt it.  Lol"
A2Q08HLDCON6RZ_11273,"Not as good as the other new Planet of the Apes movies, but still a good one.  I mean it does have Mark Wahlberg!"
A24EREP135RUB_15881,Too much time spent on childhood and not enough about their differences in musical philosophy.
A3GISRNT7BJEO8_17842,this movie stunk. I remembered it as a child being good... what have I been smoking??? this is boring and have watched it once. I guess i may have been spoiled by the quality of the recent animation.
A1CV0YPSIRAKGT_15718,IT'S IDIOCY IF YOU BUY THIS PACKAGE WHICH IS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN BUYING ALL THE SEASONS SEPARATELY. MAKE IT WORTH IT TO US! BRING DOWN THE PRICE! DRASTICALLY!
A18B39JZP5ABDZ_11767,"Pretty good WW2 documentary, covering both Nazi and allied development and use of airborne glider forces in WW2.  Documentary has period footage, interviews with pilots, and glider borne infantry and equipment specs.  War correspondent Walter Cronkite is also interviewed."
A3S8DIGQ63B0D_21289,This movie is nice in all but the people are crazy ghetto hot ass messes who just thinks about drugs sex in money the brother really needs to grow up
AC9RN6DJ953QY_639,Spice Girls were HOT. They were FUN. They were GLAMOROUS. This movie is the bomb. You must buy it if you want to see an all sexy European female band.
A36VDFR1I09IFB_22618,It's pretty funny in parts  I laughed out loud pretty much  Not a great comedy but really likable
A1DGLX5W5IGJAU_8164,The movie was really cheap and it is in great condition. I'm happy all around with my purchase.
A3F4C35NJBFCRE_17229,This movie gets good reviews here-and-there but it didn't do much for me.  I appreciate Jack Benny but not in this forum.
A1Q6V9WO0AHI07_21457,Another of Zane Grey's epic novels destroyed by Hollywood!. Little or nothing remains of the story except for the title. Fans of Zane Grey avoid this at all  costs.
A1HWFAMAC1ZQ48_21257,"I bought this movie because the article say have Spanish audio, but doesn't have. It very disgusting. I feel disappointer"
AUAETP9M2T3KE_20368,"Here is a classic story of a tragic life turned into a happy ending, if only all who find themselves in similar trappings could result like The Man with The Golden Arm."
A3LT8KGIKW3VC2_12550,"It would've made a great full length movie but being an O'Connor ""idolizer"" I'll take what I can get."
A1WVEHODRT07LO_9167,"In one of your more philosophical moods, pop in this love story. Be ready to laugh, as the montage one of the main characters life foibles  views like an outtake clip"
A2I7YAB0AXA2FA_2874,"This movie is extremely boring; has no plot and ""the end"" on screen was the only good thing about it."
A2Z9HS4YPRDUWR_1998,"I'm sure this version is ""Far superior "" to the one being released this Christmas.  Still a little ""dark"" but that's John Huston 's style.  Nothing tops seeing the play... but this is your 2nd alternative that is best!"
A1540AI9QVNXK8_20867,Teens might like it but it's a bit too violent for teens while not sophisticated enough for adults.
AHJAE899CPR41_18044,I really like this movie because i felt for the Lucus character. It's very 80's which i love because i was born in the late 80's and it's cool to see how they were back then.
A397Q6LCA6EFZ9_13500,This movie is a decent little thriller. Some things are relatively predictable but overall not bad. Worth a watch on a rainy day.
A1FOQBQZD7GZIO_16347,Interesting story line. Great shots of the REAL Fort Clark in Texas. It's not a stage prop.
AFJZK7HNPGRY5_22671,"This was my first Wes Anderson film, so I didn't know what to expect.  Had I known, I probably would not have rented it.  I just never understood what was going on."
A3KK4WJI1P1D5K_8053,"I have always loved this movie, it's a classic in my home. And the fact that I don't have to watch the old VHS version anymore is wonderful!!"
A1N2L32I29ZQ96_20739,This is not one of John Wayne's best. To me the problem was the unbillable  story..
A36QQS2R0JPFA5_1135,"Mammoth sound, perfect picture. Exactly what I expected. I had the LD. and that format was impressive it was even better then the DVD. But the Blu-ray has them all beat."
A2MOII71TYGNSE_4870,A great restoration of a film classic.  You will not be disappointed if you order this!!
A3GMRJFK0CRCQR_14614,"Cute, the first of the classic Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner Indiana Jones type movies. A simple, fun, watch. She was a cutie-pie back in the day. Oh how we've all aged so. HAHA"
A2538BG2K1FJJ5_9170,This DVD was supposed to be encased in a steel box/case as pictured and promised; not so. I did not have the time to undo the shipping required for refund or reorder due to this purchase being a birthday gift.
A14VNXS7M0JO5K_9010,"Not my thing.  This sci-fi is brutal, senseless, and has a future that I wouldn't want to live in.  So much obvious talent wasted"
A1ER6IYOMM8VCT_6132,"This is a classic 70's stoner flick. A very well written film with a great cast. If you like Fast Times at Ridgemont High, you should like this too."
ANUW7413F2AXP_7035,This is the best version of this story in modern times. Covers the book and is well acted. A classic.
A123H650X81EJK_11598,"Intriguing, and contemporaneous look at the emotion involved in the transfer of Hong Kong to the Chinese budget.  Good acting and believable. Parallels a dying man and a dying era, lovely scenes of Hong Kong.  Pretty good overall."
A2OITKFJO55W06_5662,"One of the most iconic films of the 80's, it spoke to, and for, the high school experience by saying things that high school kids feel but cannot say. Funny, heartbreaking, irreverent, soulful and real."
A25V2V2ZUIE9S2_13980,As a teenager I loved the Friday the 13th movies and thought Friday the 13th Part 3 3D was awesome in the theater so when it finally came out on DVD in 3D I had to have it.
A22UQBG4ADJGF3_20483,"After watching it for about 15 minutes, we turned it off. There seemed no point to the movie, just a lot of poor scenes presumably to set the stage."
A226O6B428VDIA_966,"...to get all three releases in one package like this.  I've watched two of the three, haven't seen the Director's cut yet but am looking forward to it when I get the chance."
A3S7P1L6IVSTZU_20346,The movie was okay.  Kid of cheesy like the show is.  The quality of it wasn't very good as years ago.  However it came as promised and in good condition.
A267IXCC7UK1HY_12943,"same jokes as in Airplane (the first of the series). . .

The first of the Airplane! series is hilarious. This is just a re-cycling, with
the same people and mostly the same jokes and stunts."
A1Q4NDCIVSJ9OS_14193,The movie is rather slow paced. There is a lot of star ogling at the expense of telling the story.
A48VUGTKXFBSP_20334,"I bought this movie because It was from my childhood, but this is not the best movie nor acting abilities."
A3HXHW3QXM5FMP_5504,TERRIBLE COMPARED TO MGM'S 1960'S ORIGINAL. WISH THAT WOULD COME OUT ON BLU RAY ALONG WITH CHILDREN OF THE DAMNED
AXCXK6G2EOA6A_1659,"Many reviewers say this movie doesn't follow the known story and facts of Joan of Arc, but it's enjoyable and gives a good overall picture of her story."
A133JP50JLSPGE_15105,"Gone nuts

I am not sure what to say about that movies, its okay. But he mess things up...All kinds of silly things."
A1YV62YOLPDL2I_1399,An awesome movie and look into up and coming punks Steve O and Heroin Bob's life in lame Salt Lake City.  You will watch this movie over and over.  I just wish it were available on blu-ray.
A3F4L6U0XIF4SG_22119,Movie wouldn't play for me........kept stopping and skipping.  I finally gave up and went to bed.
A2H71R3SV7VATW_10864,"if your a werewolf fan or a jack fan then this movie will satisfy both of your thirsty urges!
sit back and watch the chemistry between jack and michelle! Grrrrrrrr.  Growl!!!!!!!!  lol"
A2ZKCZ6AZNMPTF_3013,Denzel has had better days with other movies. The boogey man(PURE  EVIL) sure got to every one around him. Lesson learned. Don't ever open any book of EVIL or watch this movie!
A3LMKLYGIE0HFW_4220,"A decent 'B' movie. For movie without an A-list cast, it was pretty well acted. The action, direction, and writing were above average for an eastern European, low budget production."
ASEAFLMNCPQZ4_14530,"Good Movie!  A little on the romantic side and not quite the true history of Lady Jane but all in all, done very well."
A3ABWV9YWXQQVM_6479,"Great story on many levels, a classic.  Hard to believe it came out in 1999"
ARMG4L2GLW25A_2112,"Leo McKern's understated Rumpole is a joy on every level, especially if you're curious to see the subtleties of British justice. While some episodes are more watchable than others, the performances are universally excellent."
AORJB0NP013UT_714,Didn't think this was the real move because of the case but it is and we love it. Fast delivery great movie
A16DR2RBQZLBSI_2457,I missed seeing this at the movies and was glad to have the opportunity to see it streaming. Really quite a good flick.
A2VFN33XFSDW9C_8481,A Arnold classic with all his corny lines.  We like this one from the days it was in the theaters.  Now we can watch whenever we feel like it.
A30I46LSP5FMOP_19205,"Insult to our intelligence! only watches 7 mins, wish we could have exchanged to another film,"
A551XY0L7WQXU_19081,Not as great as I expected from having seen it or a SIMILAR one on TV.
A2VLF9FE68LFX6_2753,"A must have along with the ""Moon machines"" and ""When We Left Earth"" series.  High quality, excellent and rare footage, such as the moon rover and rare gems like the astronauts falling down a lot, etc.  Wonderful."
A1JHC5YJD92EX9_12197,"A look at the hay day of the mob, dark, very entertaining, much better than the modern version.  Worth watching again."
A1KIUZEOJOAVS_21639,I know this is one of those cult movies that I never got around to seeing.  I still haven't.  My wife and I watched it for about 20 minutes and decided we couldn't take any more.
A3S1IMREMJRQGM_6492,The premise of the film is despicable. Only the most demented mind would deem this an award winning effort.  It speaks to just how low the Hollywood elite have fallen.
A3CN9CCJUNIPKT_20239,"Slow moving, mildly campy feature film adapted from the beloved BBC-TV show.  Peter Cushing takes a turn as the semi-dotty Doctor, and the Daleks are appropriately awkward and mechanical.  You're better off getting your giggles from the original television episodes."
A3MZW7YS78WF9V_7283,. One of the best sci-fi action flicks ever made. This mind bending edition blue rocks. Not much more to say
A25VOQWERIQ9BN_2020,Excited to watch...haven't seen this movie in years!!  Ready to show my kids the movies we watched back in the day!  LOL
A1JBQE078V1LG2_391,This collection is the best of Newhart. They just don't make TV like this anymore. Too bad. We would rather watch these than anything on TV today. Always a great laugh.
A3NOHSAB2BIFCB_3979,What a find! I never believed it could be Christmas this soon... I love it. I have it both black and white and colorized. The colorization is excellent.
ARPP0NYHJ0A9Q_21598,"I saw this years ago and liked the concept of travelling to a different time & place thru this star gate, it's an adventure movie with Kurt Russell."
A1QC2SOHXBNQ46_23210,"Found this to be a very disappointing ""chick flick"".  Your wife or date might
love it, but you'll fall asleep."
A148ABAGOSRWCG_20748,"A ho-hum John Wayne western. Cliche ridden. Not all that bad, just not that good. There are so many better JW choices you could make instead."
A271TR81FUN8SX_3103,Was done with very good taste. Real good bump and grinds in the movie. Tells the real story of the hard life most strippers live. Enjoyed the music so much I ordered a music CD of the soundtrack
A2PUSOJ163S0HQ_8187,Loved it since I was very small  Great.  Part of my granddaughter's graduation request for all the Disney princess movies.
AFJOSH1UTYUAK_18026,Picture froze completely and then stuttered and stopped. Low budget movie with little or no discernable plot. Avoid this one.
A3FSOSQN8QNYZ3_18217,"The Long Goodbye is slow paced, boring and dull. It looks like a
cigarette commercial-Gould spends the film choking on a cigarette.
I never found him believable as Marlow.
J.Keefe"
A2R9K1M7TUF4D0_14817,Funny classic movie. I hadn't seen it in a long time and I laughed just as hard.
A3NLSQ0TW97MOO_23127,"This was a pretty cute little show.  Nothing too mentally demanding - but quirky and humorous.  I get a lot more laughs out of Hugh Grant when he is older, myself."
AR9UOKFVNBHUV_1018,"here's a movie that's really good ,it will keep you watching good Halloween movie ,it will give you lots of scares and a few laughs to go with it,"
A2H56YN65JAJY_5697,"My first impression about this movie: too much overrated and hysterical. Check other parodies, like Dr. Strangelove which is shoter and much better than this."
A789KK8Y3NAV4_8525,"I love the film. Unfortunately my housekeeper didn't recognize the package and threw it out.
My students and I were all disappointed. Great film."
A1DE28TZJ3VQ08_9792,If you are a John Wayne fan you will love this collection. I bought it for my husbands birthday. Great price.
A1GLG82FU3V3OO_1604,I saw this movie a long time ago.  I wanted to see it again.  It really is a great story and well acted.
A3RJ0LX5R4CJRY_16825,"A film that I never tire of ... so happy that Amazon Prime had it in their list. Andy
Garcia was young and he stole the scenes he was in.
A good film to see"
A3KD6ZZD5SZRWX_12984,I've always enjoyed this movie.  Eddie Murphy in his prime and at his best.  I actually like the second better. :)
A12DWQ5EXG9HIX_11656,"This was a good movie, although it left out quite a bit from the book."
AAGKECFI47XBY_8133,I really think this is one of Disney's cutest  animated shows.  I really enjoy the Elvis Presley music they used
AYR6QA16I5FTR_20511,"This is my least like movie my Studio Gibli and it is still great so but them all, they will be great for you your children and your children s children."
A20KYZBVPQWCDT_22492,"Whatever happened to subtlety? There was blood and gore before we knew the players. Too much for me although the cast are first-rate. On the other hand, my cousin liked the satire and humor. To each his own."
A18G17DD24353J_10741,Never could work up to number one the action was lost right from the beginning!! Don't waste your time or money.
A19W6XTDVSB3LT_22470,"First the dvd would not play in my player. Instead of it being in english like I wanted, it was in German. I would seriously review the outfits you do business with."
A370RGTJSOLC35_1321,"W.A. straight out of the gate, and what a start!  Begin here, then, if captivated, proceed to savor the rest of this magnificent, highly idiosyncratic filmmakers work.  It's a world quite unto itself."
A1X89MV8MJQ0UM_19769,Extreme amount of swearing that we turned it off and did not watch all of it.
A3R4OBLGEUYQQM_9968,Another pretty good movie about a renegade object from space on collision course with the earth. Good story line and good people playing the roles. I'm glad I added it to my collection.
AVOPXANTVVFD0_5164,"To me this is the most beautiful film I have ever seen that deals

head on the great social issue; the story is superb, the acting--

stupendous! It has every element of a true classic cinema. So

buy it!"
A1C8NV5EVNLA3I_2962,I'm a big Martin lawerance Fan. This was a decent movie that I had to have for my dvd collection once I saw it at this price.
A1KA6N2NO6E0LH_3929,"Swords and subculture, Immortals battle to the death for the prize.  This spawned some sequels that should have stopped at 2.  Some great music by Queen in the background."
A1TNGUYW3G9PW2_8683,Really liked the movie.  Great acting and idea.  Would be very cool to see a sequel.  Lets have them do another one.
A1LK03QPWLVTGM_15182,"Those innocent days! But how ever much the surface changes, the game stays the same. Nice to dig out this old movie. Decently directed and acted."

A174CPEO30GK6Q_22226,Terrible copy. There's a better one offered by prime video. Watch that one. This movie is a classic. Absolutely  love the character actors.
A2KS480CRT12YZ_6803,Christian Bale is such a good actor!  This film is befitting his talents and was very enjoyable.
A1M0OSCFOAMAZO_11740,"I vaguely remembered this from childhood. It's kind of corny, so it won't be everyone's cup of tea. It's sweet with a nice message, but isn't particularly Christmasy."
A1HD1HJQ2QJIXL_17561,"As another series with same name plays to some acclaim on a different channel, be forewarned: this treatment dates back to 1980's and is probably NOT the one that was recommended to you."
A3SXTAK8L3QWB_3956,It is really nice to have this version of this Classic Movie.  It is a tradition in my house to play this movie while I am putting up my Christmas tree.
AG1MDK0TA0GUM_13320,A nice humorous science fiction flick that wears well with time. I owned it in VHS and now own it again as a DVD.
A17PJADQMFK1UW_10290,Had forgotten many of the great songs in this musical production and the parts casting is excellent; really enjoyed seeing it again.
A2VE3MCWGO2DPL_15271,"One bad thing leads to a series of bad things for a hapless young man in NYC one evening.

It's amusing, but not more than that."
A32JMQL8RJKFCY_20737,"So BAD it's good!  Campy, harmless fun for all.  The card board props & pyrotech SFX will bring tears of delirious laughter."
A3EZUW46UNHK8D_5386,Great movie.  A new Classic and I always enjoyed it. Glad I finial got it for my collection...
A3URAV5K9W0JFK_3462,One of me and my wife favorites and so glad to have it on Blu-Ray
A3MKR7UW10BJRH_5092,"The based-on-a-real-life-story of this movie moved my heart.  What a brave man the main character was!  ...and, it was played by Gregory Peck ~ 'nough said."
A2JQL3ZTB4PE6L_3570,My favorite movie to watch at Christmas!!  I thought I bought it last Christmas but couldn't find it.  Of course I find it when I get this one ... lol!!  Now my parents enjoy it!
A2H25Q26XAML8P_19159,"I have seen this movie and Mark Harmon is excellent.  However, I did not purchase this film as I thought the sellers carrying it made it too pricey."
A1DSOF0EK9G06C_20872,"It seems that the parents of the Chinese wedding couple exercised too much power over them, even choosing the partners, compared to the parents of the Indian couple, who thoroughly enjoyed their wedding."
A1INH664G7CGCY_6642,"An excellent cast, an intriguing plot and excellent script.  I love this movie!  However, if one is not into psychological aberrations and/or nudity, this movie is not for you.

Everyone in the cast does a phenomenal job!"
A2608A4VOLFK3Z_2447,the stars were  out here... some of  the best ever.  what else can I say?
A1WXO1LU9O7Q2O_7654,"Replacement for my DVD collection. My VHS was showing signs of aging, but since I liked the movie on tape, surely it'll be just as good on DVD."
A16TK8L1SSCCBD_8911,"The description by the seller says it is Closed Captioned. It is not!!!  I am 80% deaf and this movie does me no good!!! It's unfortunate, I am on disability and can't afford movies very often. Shameful!"
AYPTQGZN2V9BF_14835,"It was kind of neat to revisit this old flick, but it was not as good as I recall."
A1LESXRF16HNMX_10422,I liked De Niro he made the movie somewhat believable and it held my attention to the end.. It was a good movie for a Wednesday night..
A2L1S50GABL5SI_10690,This was a collection my husband wanted to watch with my kids on spring break and add to the movie collection
A5CYW5OL2T1J6_23734,"Not Arthur's best work, and I didn't care for the dueling main character's and how he wrote a part of his life into this movie.  But I get care to see Miss Monroe getting spanked at the bar."
A310SKH8L08AQT_10322,I did not think the movie was that good. The story was flawed. It seemed to be violence for violence sake.
AH09GVB713085_8552,Liked this transfer although it is sloppy in some areas where the color is faded overall not too bad a transfer.
A1B24G5HZXXJRP_9557,Awful dialogue. Did people really talk this way or was it Hollywood's idea of how people talked?
A1P42B77OL31QU_7758,love the movie. great to watch. its great to watch with the family. Amazon never disappoints their customers. thank you for always having what I am looking for.
A2JF7LK0HU3UAL_4283,"Fine discovery for someone who is interested in war drama, particularly WW1 & WW2. Powerful & resonates."
A18CGTDZS305XM_14253,"Sweet movie....touching even though it is a bit retro!  Good chance to see Gene Wilder as the fox....very touching, shows how vulnerable he could be!"
A2B8BOWWFCHBFX_23643,This entire production should have gone to *ell in my estimation. It does however contain the necessary ingredients for a great comedy -too bad they didn't approach it from that angle...Wake me up when it's over!!
A3O9OQ2N7M9H2F_18606,This old Disney is one of my favorites. The kids enjoyed it and got a good giggle out of it.
A10YGN1IJFYVU4_23280,Unfortunately this movie was not what I thought it would be. The transaction was good. But I wasn't very happy with the movie itself.
A2EJTWHUOML6A5_2452,"Really? a janitor can just change identity and become an astronaut? This was made when Ethan and Uma were getting their feet wet, good practice for them, bad viewing for us."
A1KL3XRXPU7BUP_12922,I enjoy Sherlock Holmes books and movies.  This movie is a different take of Sherlock as it comes from the perspective of  his mid- late teen years.
A1VXL56DT59AZO_4374,"There is no shortage of war movies with tense inner themes, but this one is substantially above the average in that regard. I might not actually love it, but it's a darn good film."
A14XVZRIN0QD9U_23577,Great P-51 mustang footage but you'll have to put up with the mushy stuff to see it.  Especially liked the Merlin sound effects.
A27QYNFPGFZDT8_3131,It is the story of the designer of the Spitfire fighter plane.  It came into service just in time for the defense of England against the seemingly invincible German Luftwaffe.  An interesting bit of history.
A3TW2M0MYGB0G7_19030,This was a movie I saw when I was in High School. Nostalgic to watch again
A3QN15QBNGI3AM_2782,House party 1 & 2 is just the best it takes u back to the 80s and early 90s how u would dance dress and how music was just the best then these movies are movies to own
A38VYHH5R142YD_20559,"Not a movie or near close, just an explanation of how this cartoons are made.
Not entertaining unless you are a freak fan of learning how to imitate a successful cartoonist."
A1IY8DJ2Q6TQ8K_12205,A modern day western. I like these old 80s military action movies. Fun to watch and see these actors in their prime.
A2VLV7DQU2HIEF_13535,"Wonderful film but the Blu-ray I received was terrible - skipping, stopping.  Refund received.  Be careful when you order from 3rd party sellers!"
A29IYGR7SNPRIV_17031,"This classic film has NEVER been issued on DVD. What is on offer here is a bootleg. Don't support the theft of copyright by purchasing an expensive, illegal copy of doubtful quality"
A2YD0YKPG1T80S_7584,"Only Jodie Foster could pull off this part. She is so realistic and I liked the story line, even if portions are slightly unbelievable. It makes a good thriller."
A3DCCCLI9A62LE_1438,"This is my favorite of the series with a good introduction to the main character, the everlasting plot and the villainous corporation behind the evil."
A1YDNHBQXCUMY5_3048,"An actual movie with a plot and good acting.  Not so much often expected with too many ""rated"" movies."
AQ6SV7LDSMGBE_9169,"I love this film, as I didn't own it on VHS, I bought the DVD.
Great transfer, no extras.  Less one star."
A2CSP070G66KWY_4665,"This is an oldie but goodie.  Edward Fox is fun to watch.

FIVE STAR CLASSIC worth a second watch.

Do not watch the remake with Bruce Willis I think."
A6NLTIA75ELDM_1962,Best film I have seen in a long time. The interwoven stories of all the cast makes you wish it would never end.
A1O5QKQ5148O31_16122,"Number 3 in George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" series. While not the best of the series, it's still a must have for all zombie horror fans. An oldie, but a goodie."
A2W9J1ZCL5N1ZB_22017,"this one is funny, but not as funny as a very brady sequel. Still see this one"
A2DA17KI9AQT90_7804,"I'm not really a Julia Roberts fan, but this was a present for my wife, and she loves it, so I am happy too !"
A1IVSAEW2F74JH_17360,"This is not the original movie

Disney, the fans want the original version of Star Wars on blu-ray.  This isn't rocket science, please bring balance to the force!"
A1UQWB231DP5F1_6723,"I would have given this 5 stars if they had included 3-D versions of the first two movies, then it would have been perfect"
A1FGBNH7J31ZYG_3406,"It was  packaged well and received in good condition.  Another of John Wayne's better movies, good for family viewing.  Thanks, Bobby J."
AUVETO0JYOL9N_23806,This movie is a vigilante story and is predictable from beginning to end.  The only new idea is that this time the vigilante is a woman.
A1EU66488BUQC2_12329,"Overall movie is boring but, If you like to see this woman in all her glory, its a nice buy."
A2O2G70XOVT3Q1_47,I love just about any movie that has to do with The Christmas Carol. I can now add this one to the list.
A26IJMBOX37ER4_23621,"My customer is very happy that I could find this movie for him, so he could add it to the collection he plans to take on his cruise around the world."
A1JB7TD5JEP1TI_20668,Outstanding movie but no sound during playback. I bought another copy thinking it was my Blu-ray player but the second copy doesn't have sound either.
A39OR5K9CJQ1GO_11351,This is my intro to Joseph Campbell. I'm happy to have the cd in my collection. It does a great job of explaining how we are all connected through the undercurrent of belief systems.
A2N9Q8N88U5D9Q_17745,"This is a very disturbing and violent movie and Costner and Hurt are so scary.

I do not recommend it for the squeamish.

Also, once again the video and audio are out of synch.

I liked Demi Moore in it."
A2GXO05VHIP9V6_22550,"I can't get into any of these old 007, although Sean Connery is the best of the old school.  I love the new series with Craig Daniels....I guess the new ones are more believable to me."
A3F9UAX22LLZWK_783,"Good storyline, but it's very fluffy. Sally Field does much better acting than Julia Roberts, proving that experience counts. Tom Skerrit's character is a very stupid husband/father and not realistic at all. It was fun to watch."
A3168ACFHEC0P4_13436,"Great example of a 1950's grade B movie.

Hope they do a remake one day, with modern day special effects."
A1FN0MKOV5J1SM_208,I love these movies! I highly recommend this for all family holiday DVD collection. Kids love them and even adults find themselves entertained with these!

A1Z2ZN39LL07GI_21100,The Packaging very exclusive .. you must own if the prices right dan the lowest. Transfer movie is average  not very good. Feature not much makes disappointed. if The lowest prices may be u can have this edition.
AP3HCFD108KPK_6403,Boris at his best! A Must for those who want to have and preserve the great Horror Movies from year ago.
A25J4UMKYCKI5S_16166,"While it may lack a bit of blockbuster status (small amount of sarcasm ;), it makes up in the 'If you like scary movies, you should watch this' - department. 'Innocent creepiness' can describe this one."
AWI5YJF7TCN92_19388,"Quick--what stars Madonna and Wilem Defoe, is pornographic trash, a very bad Basic Instinct rip-off, and stinks?"
A16OWKS6EHXNO1_12067,Patrick McGoohan as Dr Ruth in this conspiracy movie about a special serum that opens peoples minds and can give them control over others.
A36DJNFRNWAD4P_15201,"With al the top stars, the story one was good, Historical to a point. have watched it multiple times. s"

A1Q5NLAGN9JGYV_9958,"I thought it would be ok, but I really did like it. I was not the same old story. I thought it had a lot of turns for this type of movie."
AOGJR2WKKETT2_18474,"It was interesting learning a little more history about Thomas Edison.  Gives the opportunity to see how this inventor sacrificed and struggled, trying over and over again before he succeeded, without giving up."
A1AMP3HAUPL793_9554,"This is not the worst adaptation of the Agatha Christie classic, but the 1940s And Then There Were None is much better, one of the greatest mystery movies of all times."
A2OC0LWPUFE1K0_6575,"Can watch this movie again and again! Nostalgic, funny, insightful, Sad! Loved ALL the characters! Kevin Spacey working at the Fast Food Restaurant has me laughing the entire time!"
ANKE519V7DVBZ_21805,"Meg Ryan is cute in this movie but not one of her best.  Watch it if you cannot find anything else.  By no means is it bad, just meaningless."
A34DCJ4LQ0YMHJ_261,This is one of the best children's videos to introduce other holidays and traditions in addition to Christmas. So glad I bought it.
AC7FAPCKH9TS1_14966,"Just great work by Lucy, comparable to the Rosalind Russell version years ago. Especially notice how the picture gets all fuzzy for Lucy's closeups. This called out some hoots from audiences when the big screen version came out."
A5EI199C7590I_18123,"Sorry, I very much liked Part 1 at the cinema but found Part II utterly silly, though well-done."
A394VWFJ6PAKD9_2830,"I liked this movie, but I really preferred The remake with Debbie Reynolds and Eddie Fisher. I liked both versions and will keep both, but I prefer the musical version better."
A1CQWYG4SLLLYY_20563,Campy but to get to see a very young Katherine Heigl in a thong swimsuit was great!
A1TZY961YP1G9E_10180,"It's a classic 70s horror flick.  The special effects were great at the time, but are pretty dated when you look at it now.  It's a lot of fun to go back and watch the oldies."
A356IY21Y089VK_9250,my husband loves this movie. I got it for him. For it's o.k. i guess. Lot of cussing in it. That i do not care for at all.
ART9KARBQWWAJ_15240,I thought this concert was kind of long. It was probably one of the best concerts back in the day but you would have had to be stoned. It was lacking something today.
A42DNERQ30666_2258,Nothing can be added to the accolades this film has received so it's pointless to expound.
AVTCCT91Q6O5N_13137,Funny as i remembered.  Had a lot of foul language though.  More than you hear in movies today.
A2ADEJQVWZ8ZG8_1504,"Outstanding Film! This movie gave me nightmares, and even though its a few hours away, I never want to visit Turkey."
A2MUGA17O4IC1E_16900,"We own this one, but not in high def. It is interesting how they show respect for each other while being war enemies and trying to out wit each other."
A2COLQKA6PU1AM_7313,Entertaining and action filled with a good story line describes this movie.  I liked it overall and would recommend it.
A64H8AM3WEAVU_5876,"I like Johnny Depp and Benicio Del Toro, but the movie seemed pointless. I don't know, maybe it's just me. I didn't get it."
A312FJPZFLWKAM_1725,"Great cast, especially Carol Burnett, who played the villainous woman in charge of the orphanage."
A29XXFNYSOSDA_16450,fright night part 2 is a good movie i recommended it to amazon customers thank you 4-18-10

AYWSFRCIMOAYE_12216,"Even on DVD, the movie looks as blurry as an old VHS tape. This movie was great in the 80's. Compared to today's standard, it's still above average. It's worth renting not buying."
A9BBSV94E21OO_18728,Worst 007 movie I've ever watched. Cheep dialogue and campy acting. I could direct a better movie.
A2SCVCJCYU2HN3_2552,This is a charming film with both stars performing beautifully.  It was especially enjoyable for me since the female star spoke only in the Liverpool dialect with which I am familiar.
A1Z7X5YKCMW1R9_8888,"While this movie is one I want to own I cannot give up my original DVD, which has spanish subtitles, in order to up grade to alternative endings, better quality, and all the other bells and whistles."
A7OX80JI75UY9_10483,Okay HD transfer but no commentary from John Frakenheimer?  Not recommended unless you are a big Ronin fan.
A2ZKIQDTUIJY8R_13639,strange. robin williams really gets into the part. listen close for the things he says under his breath.
A22DFYZ7D0CYXV_21679,"If this is the TRUE STORY of Baseball Great Ty Cobb, I don't know why they wasted the money telling it."
A42GFMF12V7XR_22832,"Skip this version, there is a better RESTORED version that offers the film in both B&W & Colorized versions:

AH9PU9RSE8306_7356,"Great movie, and the special feature sections with comments by the production crew was amazing."
AIYDPAHP3T52B_13741,"The acting was so, and so. I would not watch it again.  Maybe I'd like the book better."
A104I5Q7E9OBK8_18116,"Still waiting for a 1080p Blu-ray release of this.  Wasn't the best movie in the world by any stretch, but its a fun one to watch. :)"
AQLKQQX173KAX_1158,Love this story with the original Muppets.  All the songs and the caring and concern for each other.  Just a really nice - feel good movie.
A1IRVUGNGK42SR_5864,"Packed well.  What can I say about Hunter Thompson?  He write a tough pen, holding nothing back."
A39QYCBKS4D6E7_4917,Can not believe this is not on BR...I am a gamer and have the 360 with the HDDVD so I figured I would get this instead of the DVD.
A74MRAQ88H21V_22828,"I give it one star for the great acting by George C. Scott, but the political propaganda was a bit thick. It killed an otherwise great movie."
A3PT1WF4F1TV3D_11926,a good western with Cagney and bogie over looked cause it was released in 1939 Hollywood greatest year.
AGB0CZ7K4PA88_15458,"Not as good as the Colin Firth Darcy, but comes in second as a good version of the book."
A2JNZP8T4TJ4EH_1506,"Very good movie, as an Israeli, I love the actor who play the main prison guard who is an Israeli actor that play in lots of movies in Israel in the early 70."
A39MA8NXRQCRAV_8013,"Loved the movie - probably more than my 4 year old daughter whos' life long dream is to be a ""real princess"".  Has a great ending and just cute all around."
A2SB4TL38H4VCU_402,I love the vintage Avengers.  This set of episodes is exciting and contains some that I have not seen before.  I recommend these editions of the Avengers to anyone who appreciates the show as it appeared back in 1967.
A10BQ55L4H3BFJ_1443,really great skill book to add to my steel book collection! really fast shipping speed and great seller thank you so much!!

AEFRJ6ZBKGZV2_16673,"michael myers is still trying to kill his young neice,like in Halloween 4,but not as good as Halloween 4. This ones a stinker, stay away from this one. Boring!"
A12M8W9J511D2O_7484,Excellent movie about an unwanted stray yellow black mouthed curr that adopts a family and wins their hearts by saving their lives several times in 19th century Texas. I wish my cowdog worked cows like that one.
A1WIHNBXMGUWW5_23489,"My review is for the 2017 ""diamond"" edition of this release. The 2006 release has a 4th disc, 80 more minutes of running time, and cool bonus features that this 2017 doesn't have. Just saying"
A46HXEJF9XYZH_18805,This was just an OK one.  I sure liked the TV version of the family a whole lot better than this.
A1Z52C18T1JL2R_3371,A great cast and the humor that weaves through what could be a very sad story line makes it a film I can enjoy again and again.
A2ILHT5DLZM6LI_8359,"I am trying to buy the classic Disney cartoon movies. I don't think I saw Cinderella when I was a child, but now I have seen it. Its is as great as everyone claimed."
AW0W391IEW9IS_5154,A wonderful and moving drama. Grogory Peck was riveting in his portrayal of a christian lawyer in the deranged south. This is one of the best movies that I have ever watched. Bravo!
A3923W0OJNGUHN_12048,"It had a lot of action and well known stars. It was an older film, so the visual effects were good for that time."
A125TSEFHSTQLH_5468,got here really fast and just like it was described in the add.  no problems with this product i loved it
A1SQAUBS2ETEGI_18575,A generic thriller for a more sensitive crowd.  Near zero action and minor suspense. No real blood or violence to speak of. Well acted though predictable climax. Still watched it fully though
ACT6I64UP5WDH_16371,We really like the movie!  I think each child should enjoy a classic like this.
A28LIDUWPD23S9_1816,Lived in Montana so we can recognize the rivers they used in the film.  Something very calming about watching it. It's like watching an artist paint a picture.
A6X05XGFQMG81_11800,Very funny. Lewis Black is as blunt as always with this special and the topics are quite interesting as well as his unique view on things.
AFEKSP864VWTD_16737,"This movie is quite a stretch for the old imagination; soldiers moved around like pawns on a chessboard, only so-so acting, and Steve McQueen only adequate as the indifferent grunt, but it sort of works and is sort of entertaining."
ALPXQWZFWUXBK_14915,"An interesting movie from the period of black/white .  Though I enjoyed it , it is not as good as the original Godzilla movies."
AZEOYC4VU91P6_16257,"Great fun... Holes galore, but so what... serious science be-damned the advisors to this had no idea about decompression theory or the gas laws, but I liked the monster!"
A29C8XFEMS6P5W_2525,Love the movie and it is like a brand new movie now that it has been redone in Blu-ray and updated
A826BAXMAO8BD_18895,I enjoyed the movie and I love Monroe in it.  It was a favorite of my dads.  You have to see it once.
AP6VO2T9PX26F_8616,Great acting of course with these great actors.  I'm prejudiced toward vampire movies in October right before Halloween.  Wouldn't want to see it twice however.
A1M130QH8LYJSU_2092,"What can ya say? Great actor, great scripts, ahead of it time series. I'll always enjoy the adventures of the man who married ""she who must be obeyed""."
A8OKNE2PJNDJV_17165,"Didn't like it. Barely watched five minutes of it. Some people may like this one, but not me."
A3FCWRLSIBRQX7_8912,The case is of the cheap cardboard type. Never would have bought the movie if I'd known the case was going to be so cheap.
A2ZHTF3RG2A3VX_14068,"Beautiful cinematography until the denouement, which goes off the rails as though the director and editor were having a spat.
Overly dramatic, but if you know the story sit back and relax for a visual feast. It's really, really gorgeous."
A1TVSUTOU7S3WN_10977,"It's definitely a great book for the updated AHA 2010 CPR guidelines; however, I believe that you could learn the same information in class without prepping first. Amazon has it reasonably priced."
A1WV7FAG6YYC4_961,"""YOU'RE ABOUT TEN SECONDS FROM DEATH!!!!""  Now I just have to watch ""Batteries not Included and I'll have my fill of aliens for the day."
AZ2V31LDDWEE3_3868,"This directors cut version of the film drags It down. The one to get is the theatrical release, which is not on blue ray or dvd. Avoid at all cost."
A1H19MPGMJJ4OT_8806,"Decent early Brad Pitt /Gwyneth Paltrow movie with Morgan Freeman.  I liked it.  As a movie I'd not rate it better than a 6/10, but it is an enjoyable watch and the extras with the alternate ending are interesting."
A2TMTRFLILGX7E_4159,As a WW2 vet who served in the Infantry I would say that this is a very realistic movie.
A1KMCGJO2DHSDG_12185,"Well done, engrossing.  Though it seemed strange to see Katharine Hepburn in Greek tragedy, she did it well."
A3GRSAU3D14N02_5471,i just happened to get the soundtrack and the dvd of the movie mixed up. please excuse. the soundtrack was notable for it's own obvious reasons.
A7JK2LY3CHJ2H_8495,If your an Arnold fan you won't be disappointed its not real deep but who watches Arnold movies for depth. Decent bad guys with a damsel in distress to boot. Fun flick that won't leave you bored.
AX7N9951T0ECS_16948,Classic 80s mix a of camp and horror. Worth a watch just to see Family Ties Skippy dressed as a metal head.
AI8M4AETAD2OL_17137,I like/love  many Terance Malllick  movies including Tree of life and Days of Heaven.. This one is a loser--romantic drivel -- don't waste your time
A2VYA07KIX3RSH_11360,"This is a new genre of mystery to me. The characters are believable and the plots varied.
A very good view."
A308WGGF4L2DQM_16266,"Betty was the most popular female star in movie history, ten years in the  box office top ten , that puts her in the realms of todays mega grossing stars taking into consideration inflation

A3JPOBOTAW6NFM_371,Finally! I've been waiting a long time for this season of The Bob Newhart Show!
A2H5QPB5WWECZM_22331,I love Alicia Silverstone but this movie was a little boring and too sexual not entertaining or funny I didn't understand why everyone on the movie wanted to sleep with her!
A1UEE8PQDO53OT_415,One of the best versions of Jane Eyre .... Ciarn Hinds is wonderful as Rochester and Samantha Morton is a perfect Jane.
A208YP64N64SS6_3913,I loved the movie and had to have the cd. Plus it has the original America lyrics which is what I wanted. The songs are all very moving. Love this cd.
ACAUKRL5QFDH8_23126,"Entertaining,  Cagney was quite good in this;  the picture is not top level production, but I liked it anyway."
A3FZGQPFOESL7J_21798,Pod Race good; Jar Jar Binks bad. Ewan MacGregor good; Jake Lloyd bad. Special effects good; acting bad. Lightsaber duels good; Anakin's virgin birth bad. Empire Strikes Back really good; The Phantom Menace really bad.
ABEQP77CF79DI_1803,My granddaughter tried to watch this three times and found it boring.  As did I.  One would have to be an Annie fan to enjoy this.
A1NSQJ51KWGW7A_19950,"Eh - it wasn't one of his bests - but I gave it a go, and well - yeah - it was just eh."
A2YORACOWM6BB1_20063,It would not play on my DVD player when I got it.  I had to send it back as it was defective.
A1FZH2D3YVBY2P_14856,Funny Movie! I bought it for my mother in law and she totally loved it. She had it on VHS but it was worn out.
ARDVFUJQZ87Q5_3800,"I previously had a VCR of this movies...but time goes on and VCR technology is
no longer practical.  The color version does have several black spots of perhaps 1-2
seconds.  Somewhat annoying but beats the vcr by a long shot."
A2RYG8NK3QPUAC_14237,Pacino is amazing in this.  It was almost comical seeing his wardrobe changing over time.  He started out as a new cop out of the academy then progresses through his time working undercover.
AHVQMPMXO0BRM_21800,"A few crude words, some suggestive ""humor"", drinking, boring plot, lame dialog, and Christina Ricci can't act. Wow. And into the donation box it goes."
A9LAPV8XNKZVZ_8011,"this is a cute alternative. The kids won't get it all. They probably haven't seen all the original stuff. For adults, a couple of real good laughs, that's two more than the last two Will Farrell's. It's a charmer."
A3IGTARUP032W5_1897,"Great Broadway musical with tons of choreography, however the plot is very predictable and did not explore the depths of many actor's characters."
A14XLEP8TJ7HTU_7819,One of the all time best movies.  I can't even remember how many times I have watched this movie.  It is great and never gets boring.  I highly recommend.
AJ093IH3TA4HU_23727,"Have been a Gunsmoke fan from the start, if you like P/C then buy but if you are seeking the old charm, look elsewhere.

Gary"
ARXUTYSPF3GBW_10163,"Well made major motion picture.  Good entertainment value, nice for an evening of sitting back and enjoying classic America made cinema."
A22XGP4X3D3EPL_2166,I'd seen it a long time ago and it was still great seeing it again. Charles Bronson was in a class of a select few.
AGCB3FQOLCTLU_19216,"No matter what your beliefs about the supernatural, we can all agree that this is a terrible terrible terrible program. So badly made, but not badly enough to be amusingly bad. Just bad bad bad, very bad."
A1JAQ3NCQWZ3VE_12803,"Too many stupid people doing stupid things.
 Not amusing to me.  Couldn't make it to the end of the movie."
A2ZY10D580TMWA_10706,I'm just trying to do this movie justice by getting it's star average down because it is so disgustingly horrible.  Thank you.
AZV2Y78FIJSU6_17576,"No movie censored for content deserves to be called a ""Special Edition"". Recommend this as a possible rental, but not as a buy, even for the current price."
A3KPMQYHKE94AY_5091,"Loved the book, and the movie is wonderful as well.  Even though it's been around for years, it is a classic and would suggest anyone of all ages to see."
AJ5MCTZT34PGD_6658,One of my favorite old movie monsters. I took the opportunity to see the original film. It's pretty good for the time. It was quite successful at the box office.
A2R07URVNNXSQW_16754,"It's beautifully romantic, with stubborn pride thrown in. It's got culture, class, wit and a happy ending. I really enjoy this movie."
A2I4UXRPYB6UHW_21045,"it was not like new but very used - i did get it on time and it was the right item, so yeah."
APTP3ZOCEI9XG_10155,"I remember going to the movies to watch this film when it first came out, when I was a kid. Very good ghost story. Glad I finally got it on DVD."
A3S9HLDFMI6TG1_2739,"It was interesting to see a film made in the ancient past as far as cinematic development is concerned, but I wouldn't choose this over more modern work."
A2J1N6ISZU2ZD1_9092,Loved this movie when it first came out. Watched it with my daughter and was really disappointed at how dated it is. I will say that Mathew Broderick's performance really holds up.
ADW6FLCFZ03SC_5003,This is my very favorite movie of all time. Never seen one yet that can compare.
A37CVM16AUOV3Q_20186,This video was purchased for an 89-year-old woman who loves to watch old movies.  I do not watch movies...especially ones as OLD as this one! I cannot review it since I never intend to watch it.
A1KB74QCFZF66T_23617,"Quirky, weird and sometimes very funny. If you like Monty Python, you will like this film."
A2O3R0QFX9AOZB_22641,"Really dismal.  Lousy, lousy acting and clich? storyline and dialogue.  If watching young cops get stabbed to death and watching old cops be abusive and condescending to women is entertainment to you, this is the movie for you."
A2F26RQJQXRLP8_20520,V: The Original TV Miniseries still holds up surprisingly well after all these years. I enjoyed watching it the second time around and remember how compelling it seemed when it premiered.
A3EUFBRXQWLD9_21415,"Quality was not good.  It is labeled  blu-ray but not high def., very grainy and nor clear at all. Lots of nudity."
A2KE806EFWMQQH_23571,"I forgot how stupid this is.  I can't believe I paid money to watch this again.  I had a vague memory of seeing it many years ago, but wow...what a dumb ending!"
A3DAORHYH3ORIV_21320,It was a waste of time. The acting was bad the story was bad and very unrealistic. Don't watch this.
A2GB3S7X9KV11X_16418,this was the first to come out and when the 2nd came out i had to have the first one for collection.
A1INNGLQJBQZ0D_9387,"I gave it 4 stars as it was somewhat different then the book. So if you have read the book, be prepared for that. The movie overall was still a good movie so I would recommend it. :)"
ACR6WUBLRJGYQ_20822,"I like most movies so usually I give 4 or 5 stars. But this one seemed a little stupid, there were some funny parts."
A810FPJRGOLVP_13040,Not an improvement on the original. Just the opposite. Put your pride aside and please release the Theatrical Cut in Blu-Ray.
A3E6BJCDNN27FU_1981,Here is another Williams performance that is wonderful.  Jeff Bridges does a great job also and the pair make a wonderful movie. Interesting plot.
A8CZOOH92SXFL_1305,"I believe this was De Niro's first starring movie.
Also a glimpse of the master, Martin Scorsese.
A bit on the bloody side but way before its time.
I believe it was made in 1972?"
ANOAFB0GOMU5C_7069,Great movie...I believe it really opened our eyes to the consequences of the Vietnam war on our veterans and helped us stop criticizing and trying to understand what they went thru.  No war is pretty... Good job for Stallone!
A135NKWPQW8SAM_8591,Wow I thought there was more to this movie. I'm glad I didn't go see it when it came out. The acting is so-so and so is the theme. I was expecting more from Clit Eastwood.
A7Z162F55H0XD_451,"Will always enjoy watching  Upstairs/Downstairs.  So well done in every way.  Favorite actor, Jean Marsh, also Lesley Anne Down."
A1NHMQB9Q6QRO5_2212,"Great! This was done perfectly. It reflected the times, the people and the locale. I have watched this many times. One of my favorites."
A3J0EHYJSFXVE_19246,"It was a good adventure movie for the family.  It's what we all dreamed about when we were kids, a life in the Carribean."
A1XSMEXCJFEKPX_546,We were on the edge of our seats through  the whole movie.  It was awesome!
A1T3IQYR9AVTOQ_21713,"Story line was slow, casting was good (except Lead kid had a hard time delivering his lines).  Children in support were great and the parents were great too!  Entertaining in kind of a slapstick way."
A3HZ1YY45CPHPS_15434,"Overall a good family film.  It was for the most part historically accurate and
it told the details of the rescue well. If you like horses this film will likely please you."
A3OO0HLFXPUDTR_5661,"I mean come on, classic, so awesome. A child of the 80's and a Molly Ringwald want to be. It just soothes the soul."
AQSQMCPDP23NR_17903,there isn't much of a story its just mainly quintin being possessed off and on trying to kill every one around him the rest of the time he is the good guy
A1CRXCI3SAVCGV_11973,I watched this movie as a kid and was so happy I found it again on DVD and for such a good price! :)
A1FI6JLIK8K6CC_13790,"This was probably good for it's time, but it doesn't hold up with all the excellent Special effects available today."
A7MNE3YARYII1_18624,"Beautiful scenery does not make up for a mindless, senseless, and meandering plot. Way way way overrated. Stereotypes are annoying."
A3VUZV5DD4EYHJ_12675,"Good supporting cast and story line, with exotic shots of the everglades and a typical happy ending true to the period of time it was presented."
A267D8W5VJ71DH_4324,"This movie had me on the edge of my seat. Very dramatic and emotional, and as I learned, a story that depicts a very sad chapter in the history of US's involvement in WWII."
AI82VVQOE9SL3_10370,"A movie that  withstands the test of time. My 9 year old grandson asked for this movie, even though the special effects are nothing compared to what the do today."
A2O82CCNU9GL29_11832,"A little dated, but seeing Hugh Grant in one of his early roles was fun!"
AQ3R826WRNFRW_395,"Excellent series. Just as I remembered the dry-witted Bob Newhart. Bill Daly is a riot, also."
A1ISP282U0TP15_17310,A very good Alfred Hitchock movie. The suspense between the different classes of people on the boat builds and finally comes to grips with themselves when they realize there is no other place for them but on the boat.
A3UW0D8M5P642L_23761,Starts out great and ends just when it is getting interesting. A waste of your money for a movie with no real ending.
A3IO2U3J119OO1_19461,I mistakenly ordered this Witch Mountain video instead on one of the other five Witch Mountain videos. I purchased it through Amazon Prime and they immediately refunded my purchase price as I watched only five minutes before realizing my mistake.
A2FYL1SJHJQU7I_16370,"The repeat title function is not available. I enjoy the blu-ray upgrade but the regular dvd could repeat ""title""."
AQD9B36HQ48T9_7899,One of my favorite movies.  When you are tired and grumpy just watch this very entertaining movie.  Amy Adams is just perfect. Who knew she could sing so beautifully.
A8WZ5ICYI9I6W_3694,"THE BEST WAY TO OWN THIS ALL TIME CLASSIC ""IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE"" JIMMY STEWART, DONNA REED AND BEULAH BONDI AT THEIR BEST."
A2G1QDV76CP9RN_12644,this movie was great. it really takes me back. i would recommend it to anyone who likes the 80's genre.
A1IF2GNES3L2HC_21654,I was really disappointed in this movie.  It seemed totally predicable and not very appealing.  I turned it off halfway through.
A24BMTA23N1BE4_23628,"This wasn't as funny as I remember it back in the day.  Maybe I'm just getting old.  Good for a few chuckles, but not really worth the time."
A18QN63TV986AT_1788,"Not much more can be said for this original version of Annie other than, the writer, the actors  and us viewers are all part of one great big family  for a short while.... Thank you for taking us there"
ACZM4BESS9U0C_9684,"Last three seasons, starting with Season 5 are the one's with all the action.  Star Trek at it's best."
A2ERNWETXKNJS0_12836,"Not as good as the first but funny just the same. It's great that Shatner, in all of his overacting glory, is in it!"
A3VKLHIOS47YTK_22831,I thought it was a great movie till the last 8 minutes.  What a disgusting end and no wonder out young women have self image problems.
A3GO5BQYPDOKF_23865,Great cast but not such as good show. Only made to 2 rooms before turning off.
A2NQOVI6IEN9MH_19887,"Zombie film fanatic, but I have to say this is the WORST film I have ever seen.  There's actually about ONE zombie for the film's entirety."
A355T33393XZCR_21846,"now we have ""OLIVE SIGNATURE"" - still the same crap, Olive Films are cheap rubbish transfers and NEVER have subtitles"
ASSUR7Q0YT24C_6732,"This is a great story if you like Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn this, and THE OUT OF TOWNERS are their best work together."
A11LQ5WSMB6YMP_9884,"If Sci-Fi interests you, I think you will enjoy this movie.  Personal drama Combined with looming disaster will keep you alert for the duration of the story."
A17R4GQHT3RW2R_878,Love this movie and love this vendor. Got it for a good price and I will continue to use this vendor for future purchases.
A8IQT3EXCAWYG_22101,Very predictable movie. The undercarriage of the book is Valkerie and the many plots to kill Hitler. I would not recommend the movie to anyone.
A6Y0JU07J5564_19909,If a person is into horror movies this one is just okay. The music was probably the best part of this movie.
A2X5ENAGFQ60WJ_19661,"Awful.  I'm a huge Mel Brooks fan, but this movie is terrible.  As though he collected every bad idea that was cut from all of his other movies and strung them together."
AAJV8LX76BBQ_19693,"I guess it would be ok if you like that type of humor. But it just seemed like stupid, slapstick humor. I didn't even finish watching it."
A3H6WWISQYFRC6_18133,"Crappy acting, crappy storyline. Like who came up with this crap. The first one was fantastic then they come out with this one years later and it's crappy."
AG9D2YX5V3IOM_23520,My ex girlfriend made me watch this a week before I found out she was cheating on me. It's a mind numbing chick flick. Stay away.

A3H3GWU6R8GB6P_9075,"One of my favorite sci-fi films of all times, it inspired me to read more books written by the author."
A1R8H1LJE91KR8_8119,"My kids enjoy this Disney classic, they watch it repeatedly. It is a great movie for all ages to watch."
A2PUXHEQNC7VLF_4581,"This is Vincent Price in a different light. I was pleasantly pleased with his performance. Sure it's a little "" off beat"" but still a V. Price classic. I'm thrilled to own it."
A3V3MUJ22ZLI43_21005,It is hard for me to watch this right now as I just lost a pet of 15 years.  I do love the Bluth animation style.  His works always remind me of the Dragon's Lair video game.
A3SKZ041H14I5H_14070,"Problem is, that even though the picture restoration is great, the sound is out of context with the picture, making it irritating to watch."
A24F57EP8KCY27_23162,if it's a very rainy or snowy day and you really have no other options
A3EUK0MA2T8816_12583,"Very funny family entertainment for all ages, this type of humor is never out of date."
AXSES4EXE179H_23095,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.
ADBGEG2MSJM7U_4035,The all time Christmas classic. Jimmy Stewart wins the battle for hearts and minds. Great movie for children of all ages. This is a movie to watch on Christmas eve when spending time with family.
A9TMVPKAXEJSX_4587,"I usually like Reeves' movies, but I didn't like this one. It was boring and dragged on."
A32FPMBFK9ERU0_3292,hilarious comedy about Dracula.  Love Leslie Nielson and the physical comedy in it.  Really a funny movie for the Halloween time or whenever
A30BDYOKZ7H141_2840,"This is an older Jackie Chan movie.  I'm going to make this pretty concise.  Jackie Chan does a great job in some really great and long fight sequences.  In this movie, Jackie plays himself."
A3BKR3RCAZ7IOX_7118,Strong performances by Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe make this a better than average ghost story.
A11RPHRCOKEP2O_14496,It's a somewhat scary movie of an entity raping a woman unseen. it had a social value to be aware that we don't know what exists and what doesn't.
A3432MKHZF71GX_20187,Ok version.  Very predictable.  Rent it to see what you think before you buy it!
A26NECI2KRMQHG_13490,This classic film is truly a fun movie to watch. The stars are both wonderful actors and the music and dancing make this a truly enjoyable film!
A2U4FXQ0SZE2PU_4960,what I was looking for. will tell my friends when searching for items to always always always check amazon first.
A1QA3QX2C8DN1B_6981,"Great haunted house story. Well told. Creepy. Unique!  This is one of the best horror films I've ever seen. Not super scary, but creepy at times, and very well told."
A1RJU6EQWR6X6S_11507,"A very enjoyable film--my husband and I loved it.  Well acted, well written, great soundtrack.  Great date movie boys, enjoy."
A34ID0O6SVO83G_14421,"Love the film, but the blu-Ray sucked  ... Save a few bucks & buy the regular DVD ... Filmed almost 50 years ago and they did not enhance the quality of the film"
A2R6PCYLROHIV1_5377,I LOVE this old  classic bible movie with the true colors of the bible story
A3LHSP45855LQ2_19998,"Despite the recent creation of this Charles Dickens' dramatization, it feels as if it were done decades ago.  The acting quality, the cinematography, the picture quality just didn't give the reality one expects now for classic novel dramatizations."
A1GAKL6SA09SRJ_277,According to my daughter the grandkids really enjoy this.  Morgan a bit more she is 3.  Carter is just going on 2 in June.
ABFWIIN89URT7_18457,This movie sucks the life force from you. It is so boring with such crappy character development that you will come away regretting the loss of your life in its play time.
AE8JBORN4YR7F_17383,I gave it shot thinking it had to get better.... Wrong. Unless you are really bored and love bad moves. Pass.
A250KH95LYQ7V8_2241,My son loves this movie. I can't say I do because I'm not necessarily a fan. But my son sure loves Elmo and this movie gives him constant Elmo rather than brown up bits in Sesame Street.
ARFP7DXIYEF35_23879,The bad editing turned me off to this movie. I didn't need to see the wires to know that they were using them. Thru the whole movie I spotted items that should have been edited out.
A1RBGPLOQA4E0P_4362,Shows the perseverance of one man in the midst of the insanity of war. His leadership when it counts is in stark contrast with his desire for anything other than a leadership role.
AQY88N2WZAK0Y_12541,"Good western with a few places of comedy. Marlene Deitrich is the obvious inspiration for Lillie von Stoop. Attorney General Harvey Korman was based on the Brian Donlevy character. But, which character was inspired by sherriff played James Stewart?"
A3S3L9CGOGGPYB_4493,I bought this as a gift for a friend.  Delivery and quality of product was as expected.  No comment about the movie.
A2CJRAMK5VIZH9_21591,"This movie has not improved with age, but I rewatched it so I could understand the movies that followed.  That said, Jar Jar Binks really is a racist caricature, and Jake Lloydeven allowing for his youth really is an inadequate actor."
A3U8J6HOIYKIFM_22416,Slow and dull movie. I couldn't watch all it of. It doesn't get any better as it goes along. Wasted my money.
A3PQZ3PNGMIHYZ_10267,"It's the story of a professional killer and a journalist who became close, and the end is great."
A13IP54XEYMO20_3381,"This is a great funny movie! You can't help but smile and laugh at all the silly gags, it is what I call dry humor, takes a certain personality to appreciate it. But I love it!!"
AP2XEOK2G8SF0_3356,This has got to be the funniest vampire movie I've ever seen! Leslie Neilson is a riot! Mel Brooks is amazing as well! I recommend this to anyone who feels like laughing their heads off!
A1WZ9HVZYLCVEW_2927,This is a very good movie.  It shows how someone with care/love can take care of a person they love that has dementia and can't take care of themselves anymore.  Also to honor that person that has the dementia.
A29IF7O5FIW9FA_12552,"Predictable Thriller of the ""Gaslight"" Genre. Great Cast and Beautiful Fashion Designs by Irene.
Quality of DVD is Good."
A1X2N8KBEBUDNO_7502,"Have read book countless times-Watched movie? Is a gem for all ages. If any have never experienced this book and/or movie, the connection of reality/feelings is without explanation, worth every second."
A1R9BWWR0YJP59_2320,It came right when it said it would and it's in great condition and was so funny. I recommend this for all.
A1AJDOL1S8UJYV_15653,"It's just a bad movie.  I love old movies, but this one is just real bad.  I would return it if I could."
A48O6K9PJCONX_4331,Just a lot of shooting and gore without much story.  It never went beyond the fireworks.
A2SX88ZKFUNXKW_13838,"It did had some funny moments, it was an okay movie, I found myself not really paying attention during some moments."
A2EK4LWXEYKQ91_3951,It's a Wonderful Life joins my collection of essential holiday films. Nice to see the classic film without commercial interruption.
A31HZV6X3JX4D5_11258,"Dunno why so many Kevin Costner films have to start out with gratutitous gore.  But this is one of them.  Skip ahead, the rest of the movie is wonderful.  Filmed in and around Pine Ridge South Dakota."
A285J4QQ7K15RF_264,Definitely helped me with reducing my frequent urination when I utilize the exercises...even from day one!
ADGR3XB512CM1_304,"I'm buying classic moves.  I remember this from long ago and since I liked it then, I bought it so others could watch it."
A17RFKCYS69M3Y_14583,This is NOT the uncut version. Too many things have been edited out to list
AXQTHJOJ33DNA_17021,"This was a strange movie.  I guess it was a Disney's attempt to suspense.  I thought it dragged a bit at times and the end was silly, but I enjoyed it."
A3OBQ0BGEJZAL3_7411,"Great product in great condition for a descent price! This has always been one of my favorite movies, lucky to get it at a fair price"
AG3NN6B4D1FJI_22517,"This is a decent film, in the vain of Leslie Nielsen's ""Naked Gun"" trilogy, but it lacks the constant jokes that made those great.  It does have a bunch of memorable scenes, but that's about it."
A3ORRZ1GTYIEG1_20585,"This was okay, as movies go, but kind of unbelievable as reality goes. But, I prefer the old movies over most of what is offered today, so I would watch it again!"
A2G2R8D7CGHDJ_2553,"Great film with two great actors.  Funny, witty, charming.  Allows you to see that although education may make you smarter, it doesn't necessarily make you better."
AO8EUXU3N44RC_15624,the value of the movie itself is less than zero.  i wasted two hours of my life on this perfect mirror image of vapidness of Hollywood as a soulless place to live and as a movie manufacturing factory.
A12XDFS1EKZEQ4_6993,I bought this dvd for a Christmas present and I know they are going to love it. This movie reminds us of are teen years. Winona Ryder character is my favorite. Reality does bite after high school and college.
APDO0ENLPDRS_35,Henry Winkler is a better actor than he gets credit for.  He makes a credible American version of Scrooge.
A2KF3PJW24FBDQ_3118,This is a very well-told story of the man who designed the British Spitfire with some wonderful actors including David Niven and Leslie Howard.  It also includes a nice documentary on the topic at the end of the film.
A2G88ZXJC18NMP_2988,I use to watch this show when I was younger and am glad I can still watch the program
A2KR5X4NJ40PQF_22001,"This story has been told so many times over the years, it's hard to find something original in any of the remakes.  I though Hopkins was very good as Bligh."
A29YXBFTD7QUP3_7672,"I watched Old Yeller at the Movie house when I was a kid and Savage Sam was on the Walt Disney show, Now I am sharing these classics with my grandson."
A3DCIMEK9VI79J_10010,i like this movie!  I saw originally when it 1st came out but now it's  an Error message  that shows up!
A3QG35MFKOH66Q_20499,Go subject by not produced as well as it could have been. More time should have been spent on autism and the lack of its understanding.
AJI274VTPS98E_12987,"If you like horror movies you should enjoy this updated take on a classic, one time watcher"
A1TVMTW5GX4DYX_1696,"Definitely a DVD for your library collection.  All three actors were
great.  Very entertaining and talented stars.  A must buy!"
AXHUK3WXOQ583_5423,"I really love this movie. It's entertaining enough to keep children interested and adults can enjoy it also. And the music and score for the movie are absolutely beautiful, as well as the animation."
A31DL5N2Z7C1R5_12184,"A fun story and the best one involving Jack the Ripper. Plummer plays Holmes with aplomb and is more accessible and likeable than some other portrayals. Mason as Watson is, well, perfect."
A1Q887X2EV3MKD_2700,Glenn Close was a good choice to narrate this story.  She did a nice job telling the story and the graphics were nice and simple. It wasn't scary so children should be ok to watch it with their parents.
A3874APXYA7GNV_22960,"Some intrigue, violence, and laughs. Just what you want for a Friday night at home. Well worth the rental price."
A17WER66R17JEF_11810,"I find Lewis Black's sense of humor similar to my own. I do not always agree with him, but I enjoy his performances. I would recommend this to any one."
A74MRAQ88H21V_3058,"Burt Reynolds is great in this film.  However, the film itself very poor acted by other cast members (Demi Moore), and poor direction.  However, it is worth seeing if you are a Burt Reynolds fan."
A12U3RZ3KD30HE_8979,"I hate this movie, but I will give it two stars because I love Ridley Scott. I have watched it twice and both times I feel sick at the end."
A1CV19Z3EDXMJ6_5209,"Is this FULL Coverage UNCUT film? The 26th Anniversary Edition has BETTER quality in picture and sound, but they CUT off 10 min worth of scene. WHY????? I hope this ORIGINAL not so well made DVD is at least UNCUT?"
A3JDNMUI86DTTS_9891,"Aside from the completely preposterous ending, this is a good film, with a very tense and entertaining story. Each act leads into a more dangerous, sinister revelation. Good fun."
A26HF3AJ0Q5MT6_4322,True representation of infantry combat and the HORRENDOUS decision to commit Army forces into the meat grinder of the Hurtegan Forest - which was ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS strategically.
ADRH9RBV9NQS_6629,I saw this years ago when I rented it. Everyone is so young and as usual Kevin Spacy does an amazing job.
A2KJOWQAADBFM8_14018,"This one was pretty good, Jason finally gets his hockey mask, shoots and arrow gun into a women's eye, very gore and brutal."
A33CUOVDQB6677_22,Excellent story that reminds you - to love yourself and other as God/Jesus loves you.
A2LW015HURUUB1_14959,While this movie is entertaining and uplifting you can't beat the original Auntie Mame.  Ms. Russell brought something to the part that was lacking with Ms. Ball.  Overall I recommend watching it.
A2A3XI1YHAOY1K_14460,its alright its scary i watched the whole thing it goes to your  head that stuff really happens to
A1S5ZQ61RFCSOE_22729,"I saw this recently, in fact it was the only Harryhausen film I hadn't seen.
 Total garbage, put me to sleep."
A35Z12H2G089VU_4071,"This was about people under pressure (ahem), not flashy billion dollar special effects.

It succeeded perfectly."
A1DBCUSELB970S_533,One of my favorite movies.  Always love watching this. It's one you can watch over and over again and it never gets old.
A3IY57SKZLCHN3_22737,It's clever but silly naive 15-year old schoolgirls sleeping around doesn't grab me. Is this the norm? Maybe in California? Jane Austen would hate it. At least by the standards of her day.
A3LH58L999UTMC_20518,"Love both actors but the story could have had a better ending.  All in all, I still thought parts of it were fun to watch."
A6WRB9TK6XY62_3262,Hilarious classic!! I love this movie and it came on time and was brand new just as listed.
A31X9O49RQUNZ1_1505,"Excellent script and music, both of which received Oscars. All-star. Anamorphic widescreen picture looks great."
A2NUHWMHA9XNKV_1586,"thought its ok slept in the middle about it, it had its moment of good scenes but i have seen worst when they are doing sequels"
A1Y5RYRM4AFUKC_11263,"If you ask me, this movie would have been fine without the gour and violence.  I suppose they were trying to portray how things were back then though...  But, other than that it was very good, very touching.  THE END"
A35RCE15OI0ENL_15903,"A great old movie. I can watch it every year.

Susan and Kevin are great together.

""Play Ball"""
A3CUVE45JVZ7LA_18551,"If only Mel Brooks had made this completely silly movie maybe it would have had a chance...or maybe he did! A complete farce, start to finish...you decide!"
A2O9FRST0DEJFN_4279,"One of the Duke's best films. It definitely inspires you to be a better man then you were yesterday, and its also great for anyone who enjoys films about World War 2 or the Marine Corps."
A1J9MMBMXMO5NP_22779,"Different, somewhat entertaining, average acting, I expected a better experience and was disappointed as the movie progressed."
A3FSOSQN8QNYZ3_17934,"Gary Cooper in a good western - what more could you want. Plus, Julie London, smoking hot!
Coop is good, very good as the ex-outlaw, trying to go straight. If you like westerns, this is for you.

Jerry Keefe"
A1HAKVMGCST6H5_11067,"Great ideas from someone great imagination with a little for the scientist, archeologist, and a very lazy military aspect thrown to add the humor .  They also throw in a little romance without taking it too far."
A2JTVB49ZF04BB_9292,"Entertaining film. I liked the visuals, the suspense, and the twists. Eva was beautiful. Grant played the part perfectly with good humor, I just didn't the like character. Not enough hero in him."
A147T6SLKKQ8ER_10579,"It doesn't deal with Hannibal as much as I'd like and the classic unspeakable white fluid being thrown at Jodie is certainly nauseating, but, it does help lead you to Hannibal's genius."
AALALZYCP2QOQ_8799,Love this movie Amazon was suppose to give it to me as a purchased or whatever own it stream thing. But They never did and for some reason canceled my item. But the movie is great
A3VZQU0XTS366S_16210,Had to view this for a film class. I found it long and boring until the end.
A16EAJTQ59LK8Z_6941,"Go to ""Extras"". There press the up button one time and then hit ""Enter"". Now you can test yourself with two hidden games."
A1PIOP87VTLAV9_14078,"At the time this movie was made they did the best they could with the graphic technology they had back then, this movie is both cheesy and funny at the same time, I recommend if you like Jane Fonda."
A11DX53E35B172_7137,"Not quite the best competitor to Sixth Sense, but a God thriller that keeps you guessing. Bacon does a good job at being Kevin Bacon.  I like the little kid too."
A285A55TO0M4WW_13032,Can not really rate this product because it was bought as a gift for my father who had it on his wish list
A35OWJ161BBKHG_17512,The movie was from a German source and would not play in my DVD player!
ASKZB335FQ11X_2075,"Watching this on a 60"" Sharp LED TV the picture is better than I thought it would be.  I can see the individual strands of Annie's fuzzy hair!"
A37QGJ9HL0ZYT3_22534,"Molly Ringwald is great as a crazed college girl who will do ANYTHING to get the baseball player she loves-including murder, of course.  However, the rest of the film is formulaic and barely watchable."
A188HGF5R5M754_15022,THIS FILM IS A CLASSIC - IT IS WORTH WATCHING TWICE AS THERE ARE SO MANY TWISTS AND CURVES. ROBERT REDFORD IS AT HIS VERY BEST AS WELL - R.D.A.
A20L037OGCIXJB_3052,"Worth watching to see Demi More in here prime.

Demi is pretty good but this movie is to see a Younger Demi with her great body.

Burt Reynolds is lame"
A1GV5U0I80BRCA_81,"Good remake of Christmas Carol with relatively few twists.  Set during the great depression in the U.S. Henry Winkler is generally good, but gives a few too many Fonzi looks for me."
A2F7BR7ACL3653_19069,"Of course Henry Fonda died.  I would too if I had acted (and I used that word loosely) in this, the worst movie of all time"
A3H98LTZ2WV66E_10724,"This is a basic bare look back at the 5th championship the bulls won.
Some highlights of the season and then the same in the playoffs/final.
Really no insight to the behind the scenes from the season."
A2TR03D5W7NP8R_15992,I was pleasantly surprised about this true story.  Good acting and very informative story.  I really enjoyed it and so did my students.
ALIKSP1SAQDPU_23265,Found it a little boring and a little degrading. It makes American ladies look like bimbos. Perhaps they were?????
ALKCA6WORXMJL_12093,OK-great cast; but both actors phoned it in.  If not for Genevieve Bujold there would have been little character development.
A24VCDADYAIHAM_9116,"It's dated, but it's a charmer in an offhand way. The humor is clever, and Meryl Streep is excellent in downplaying her role just enough to be the perfect foil for Albert Brooks."
A3JMJPXA7J16GU_16895,"A good chick flick with Barbara Hershey and the usually annoying Bette Midler. Bette is funny and slightly annoying, but a heart warming story. A very young Mayam Balik plays Bette Midler's character as a youngster."
APW66V7MGKMR6_13200,"It was a good movie; it kept  my attention. However,  I expected it to be  more romantic and not quite as long."
A3FB4UIM7CKKBP_3050,Someone borrowed my VHS tape but neglected to return it.  I'm very happy that it is available on DVD as those require less space when they're stored in between viewings.
A2X7OPEUPCZ836_2474,DNA before DNA was fashionable.  This is an excellent movie about using DNA for selective purposes.  Rather than give the plot away get it and watch it and be fascinated.
A41I67QYRAOSQ_14810,"Excellent story line.  However, you may be turned off by the old props and sets.  Nothing close to what we have today.  I'd buy it only if I wanted to take a stroll down memory lane."
ABWGTXGEVLMXD_12293,"Great classic family movie. My boys are into hockey and we watched this one family move night, it kept them entertained."
AQISTWK1MP33P_13573,I watched several minutes until I realized how silly the movie is. Not my cup of tea!
AY0GCKR70J9F5_20572,"We only watched about ten minutes of it. It wasn't much like the original Land Before Time, and the quality of the video was poor."
A3W4LG35FH77TV_8805,Now I get all those things in pop culture that look like S&M and bondage gear - George Miller and Mad Max did it!
A26Y4NZC99I8E5_18921,Although a cult classic it is a chance for David Niven to play the comedian
A1F1WWCUAQZISQ_4658,Great actors and interesting subject matter. Steven Speilberg always does a great job getting the story across. It makes you feel and think. Those are the best kind of movies.
A391DTMN9ABF8C_16038,"As noted from the Cinema Laser website, although filmed in a 2:35 aspect ratio, the dvd version is closer to a 1:77 aspect ratio which is fine. Very good film and excellent video quality."
A1K7HNKPUQVTD2_12868,"Interesting ""what if"" to see what could have happened if Holmes and Watson had teamed up at an early age."
A2I7OXHWWVR3JV_23054,Slow action. But is a scary movie with great actors. Its have subtitles in english. Beware of the end. See it.
A1Q8D2ELXXE8TC_22494,"This is another movie that just didn't hold up to the passage of time - don't bother, you'll be disappointed."
ABL45LB3PAIL7_4792,"What more does one have to say:  ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" & Gregory Peck.  How awesome can one get!"
AQPK52JT5LPA3_8181,Just another perfect Disney Movie. Great graphics and beautiful backdrop. Stich is a great character and the surrounding group of support is awesome. A great movie to sit down and watch with your kids.
A2TX01GMOIBXPF_4348,Realistically and dramatically follows three days of a U.S. soldier's live during an unnecessary and costly battle during WW11.
A2F17E6BLTFK2J_4157,"War, a never desired action, sometimes makes the most unlikely heroes. The plot has many twists and the ending is pure irony. Well written screenplay and worth the time to watch."
A1WVR1PC0QKMRG_9087,"This is all the blade runner you'll ever need, along with a few models and your own unicorn.
At least until the blu-ray version comes out."
A3P1508PZ0UADD_1942,"Outstanding movie, and acting.  Watch it over and over again.  Too bad it spawned so many idiot ""wannabes"" to pick up a fly rod and clog the riverbanks."
A1N0X4MFZ34N39_13487,"I liked the story and the acting, but I don't agree with the free-sex lifestyle.  I wouldn't watch it again or recommend it to anyone."
A1OYCQJ07A3034_4442,I just love love love this movie..... I can't say enough about this movie the humor the sentiment the truth about the way they live.... The actors are brilliant... They really did awesome... One of my favorites....
A34OUPGH2AYQW7_3120,Very interesting movie that I had never seen before.  The Spitfire did a terrific job.
A1HFMQDAA2SC1W_16856,Very poor quality CD. It looks like a bad VCR recording. Is this the best they can do? I am very disappointed and will send it back.
A25N82GOMQ3DVO_8760,This movie was adorable.  I thought the message that each girl is a princess was a nice one for little girls.  I would watch it again too.
ATFK55IXDHS8M_18767,"Used to love Bill Cosby, now I think he is disgusting and regret spending my money on it."
A4EP2HY72BAF7_9480,This was an interesting but dated movie. Not very well done by today's standards but it held the interest and ended up enjoying it. The film craft was missing but the true story held things together.
A26ONF960LRHYI_9589,Not much to see in this movie unless you like bad violence and worse acting.
ALQGU53I8TCU6_10605,It not bad movie about a dog Story It would be good for  anyone to watch it would pay to pay it
A3O9G3EUBQSBCQ_5517,"A suspenseful and great film. I'd prefer this over the original one. How can you go wrong with John Carpenter? Packaging was good, shipping a little slow, but overall very good. Well done."
A3JEIHWAI37EFG_17654,"Lacked a plot. Little or no character development. I got so bored, I stopped watching half way through the movie."
A1ZZ2EB6FCY8MW_19557,"I was hoping for something as funny as CLUE, but this one doesn't compare. Stupid and sometimes racist humor. But, it's OK because the all-star cast is pretty awesome."
A2PYCES966FDAR_9210,"Great collection and insightful information on the ""making of"" process. Never loved the movie Bladerunner, yet I possess a great appreciation for it."
A2X27FQSHP418Y_17441,"This is a typical Cruise vehicle: the ""charismatic"" character beating the ""bad"" guys in almost non-existent screenplay. How Duvall is in it, I don't know..."
A12EDGP5ZGZVJD_11495,"I'm not sure what was worse, the acting or the story line.  Not at all what I expected.  Don't waste your time or money."
A3QN0UEOJG984J_18680,over priced in my eyes. renting a streaming for $3 is crazy high. the movie was good however.
A3ILIDTK91224O_1945,it had been years since i watched Robin in this movie!!! it is funny and heartbreaking to watch him knowing he is not longer with us!
ARR1DJAGD5992_6781,but it'll certainly keep you thinking. And considering things you never thought of before. Image quality and sound - first rate. Extras - fine. Knock out capacity - amazing.
A329TTW9VJ2NBU_6770,If weren't for the great acting of Spacey this movie would have burned.  The plot is so uninteresting and lame I can't understand the great reviews.
A1P8U9DXXW614T_4562,This is one of my favorite comedies of all time!  It has a great soundtrack also!
A1EVWQYLY9Y3IC_20190,the use of a young actor to play Hudson during the narrative was amateurish and annoying.  Very annoying.
A3RXQE6E8Q8AQ4_5438,"Wonderful movie! Great music, beautifully animated, and it has a wonderful message about the treatment of others! Great movie for kids. And me. lol"
A2D32PBVXOFP6W_14030,"A kind of dull, badly acted version.  Honestly with the quality of actors in this movie, I was hoping for better."
A139R1VPHUMTEO_19997,"Ms.  MacDonald never looked better!  The three girls gave her nice support, and of course all three
Went on to better things!  Surprisingly,  the maestro holds his own as an actor in a rather charming
role"
A2DFWGM11UXUE_11489,I had high hopes for this movie. I thought it stunk!! I am a big Jeffery Combs fan and this is not it!!!
A3L61G6N7AT8N2_19265,"Nearly puked while watching this.  Not even funny, stupid, stupid, stupid!  Johnny Depp is not only tedious, but idiotic."
A2H5PGTC47VNA6_6877,It bored me to death.  Even when I fast forwarded.  Even when I tried to crochet so as not to fall asleep.
AI89DW0KI0128_7764,"Just enjoying watching it from time to time, funny and well done.  Not close to a favorite.  Would always recommend to anyone."
A1YFXK97Z61X1C_3846,"Funny, I loved this as a kid, watched it with my kids and found myself unable to explain why I loved.  Seems low budget, convoluted story, muddled characters and spotty action.  I should have stuck to remembering liking it."
A2RPP75BN21YXG_14387,Used God's name in vain withing the first few minutes so I stopped watching it.
A3VLMGU2G4B9NS_2850,Not my cup of tea. This movie is the worst end-time movie that I have ever purchased. The price is the only good thing about it.
A2KXWHDW8P877G_11422,"Maggie Smith is a wonderful actress but, this one did not do it for me."
A1ELGLU71NVSG7_8611,Close to the book and very entertaining.  One of the few movies I actually liked the dynamic of the leads.
A11QIIDU1TME4_22210,"Awful!  I watched for half an hour only and tossed it in the trash, as not even my friends wanted it!"
AWPA2ZUGLMXLW_1056,This movie has great actors and a very good story. I Love It! I recommend it to all Julia and Susan fans.
A1TDJ1A58JXXBS_9755,"Pastiche homage to b-movie adventure films but nowhere near as entertaining.  No real story, just plot. No real atmosphere, just art direction.  No real direction, just mise-en-scene."
AP599TKODDVN8_8111,Great movie for kids and adults.  My family love to watch this over and over again.  Love the importance of family out in this show
AWBXDSNVRS7C0_3355,Good example of a foreground mystery accompanying several background mysteries. The mix of relationship mysteries unraveling with the crime was highly entertaining!
A1QJQJIDKS2B9D_23377,"the characters are very loveable, however it took them too far into the story to get .together, but I stayed with it."
A392CZ6KK0MH5X_7161,The story is interesting it keeps you guessing and the acting is great the scary scenes actually put u in a nerves state this movie is a great buy.
AQIY318OX7XYW_17902,I love Dark Shadows but this movie is a tedious silly film made only to give fans something more to see
A1J4H5U7JFZR3H_14462,"As a sequel to ""Romancing the Stone"" it wasn't  as funny as it could have been but it had surprises for a around every corner. Great for a collection. Arrived just as promised by Amazon.com."
A1HSMK6S478PM5_1363,One of the best old school horror movies ever. Forget the remake and watch the original and Fright Night 2. The first one is the best.
AC5OIB26P6LK2_17761,"As a story for Bo Derek's breasts and body, ok, but the rest boring watch on cable Save your money"
A1W2UHSKIRNQVE_12021,This is a very entertaining little film. I loved it. It's honest and clean. No sexual overtones which really just kind of gave it a pure sweet feel.
A1I2PA621HCWBB_17796,...just not in this film so much. This film is a bit of a stinker. Easy to pick apart. Pretty lousy overall. Christine Lahti sure looks great. But the film fell flat.
A2GGA9Y08JHFIG_8778,"Like the movie, love the songs. Whitney is one of my favorite female vocalists...so much talent, but so much sadness."
A1IAALNPI1TCM7_3742,"In color or in b/w - it's both here in excellent condition.
Best color I have ever seen in a colorized b/w movie!!!!!!
This is the best print I own now."
A3B70GUTLS10N5_21338,"It started with Eve lives from the performance of Charles Laughton. In bed, awaiting death, the new bride of his
son pretends to be rich. Trouble starts when Laughton recovers. Not bad but not great."
ACN2TYFT0YXM4_3709,Always wanted to own this classic movie.  Went as far as to buy both B&W and color!
A1K2LJWKBKZ6F9_20691,A whatever movie. Entertaining but kind of a waste of time. Good for teenage girls
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_18013,"Saw it couple years ago, we need not just stuff like this but more stiffer sentences and less recreation in prisons to make sure convicts aren't living in a club fed."
A3AFL34Z9HKTAU_22817,Was excited to get this movie.  Only when I got it I realized it does not work on my DVD player.  I should've read the description more carefully.
A177K38NX2DY56_18535,I did not really care for this movie.  I think I should have read the back cover a little more closely.
A8UY3MA5ZE7DF_14985,"This version came in second for me.  Though good. It didn't compare to the one with Kate Winslet etc. in it.  Others may have
a different opinion but I will stick with my favorite of the two."
A1HV6ERWD6M33L_5511,The movie's okay. I loved the original when I saw it years ago. This version doesn't really expand on the old one it merely adds a few more scenes and reverses the leadership roles of one of the key kids.
AU1N018WVND8Y_9459,"This was a perfectly awful movie IMO, but if you love sub movies, I guess you should watch it just because that's what us sub movie fans do. I'll be taking mine to the used DVD store :D"
A1PHDUKXNDKGP_17616,"I kept reading other reviews that rated this highly - but I still like ""A Christmas Carol"" with Alistar Sims in it.  He plays Scrooge the BEST."
A3G9UENRNJXRR4_7367,"A delightful tale. I am no fan of Jane, but I can't find fault with any of the actors in this one."
AST4L7TX3N8EX_9006,"Thought I'd like this movie more than I actually did after seeing it years ago.  Too depressing, grungy, and socio-phatically violent.  Very hard to care about any of the characters."
A3LLE02CO1W5T1_1071,"Purchased this DVD as a Christmas gift for a female member of the family. She really enjoys the movie and is glad to finally have it on DVD. Great price, fast shipping."
A3DGCIZZ8O124X_9571,Thought the full frontal nudity was unnecessary. I liked the story. It was outlandish but interesting.
A3OKYG9KWUTO2H_23299,Not the best or the worst period piece I have watched. I did finish the series-adequate acting and no surprises
A3GKTYBTQZ6DX9_1011,"The last time I seen this was thirty years ago and I'm glad I bought it! You get a three dvd set and its cool !!! The sound track is really cool in surround sound !!!!
  D. L. Rupert"
A31T3VAZKGFMEK_18526,"It was okay.  I enjoyed it, but don't know that I'll watch it again.  Picture & sound quality were just okay.  I would really have liked to preview this before buying."
A1C44B5PH027II_2708,"Saw this one as a kid, and was thrilled to find it on Amazon!  Got it for my sister for Christmas (shhh!) and I know she will flip.  It's hysterical!"
A1X7FS1H4R02W1_5480,"There credit cards are being taken away, They are hiding out with the people.
Funny story!"
A3E825JD7597YD_16013,I liked the story and the performances by George Segal and Glenda Jackson were great. Funny and charming.
AWMNPNH2LXFGX_14544,Typical unreal Hollywood stuff. I'm generous rating this three stars. What more can I say about a cornball movie - view something else.
A2K3KSV8GZ00IA_21709,"The product doesn't have the slipcase !!! You should specify it, when the first print is replaced with another kind of package."
AGNLZRSMX0PEC_22938,"What can I say? I grew up on these movies. There is a bit of nostalgia for me. I have to say that even though these movies are a bit dated  [and campy], they are still fun to see"
A1HCZQJ7BURNJT_20839,"The movie was cute, but really slow. I know I am am an American and if something isn't blowing up, we gripe about it. But this movie really was slow. But it was cute."
A2P08S6SHDPDRM_16219,"Still a grand story!  Would have loved hearing the dialogue in English; however, the subtitles were sufficient."
A30V70JM6YXVXI_21663,"This Woody Allen comedy-drama is 5 star, but the quality of this DVD was not. The color and contrast is too dark making it difficult to see some scenes clearly."
A3NSE7T2BLZ7VR_18401,The picture of the product with Gene Hackman on the cover of the jewel case IS NOT what I received.  All I got was the movie in a blank jewel case.  Isn't that false advertising?
A3ELUBHR2H9I6N_12581,"This movie has a very good plot, however the distorted background sound, particularly the music takes away from this movie."
A551XY0L7WQXU_6393,"As original was seen, so is this.  Even though long ago.  LOVED it.  Must have.  B&W.  Karloff superior, as always.  Must for horror/Karloff fans.
Bought for gift.  Just fine.
Cecy"
A3OEBWYKH1B266_22856,"Decent movie - particularly when it first came out.  Looks really cheesy now.

Blu-ray quality is average at best."
A1X054KUYG5V_23345,"The Bottom Line:

One of Kevin Smith's lesser works, Mallrats sometimes suffers from poor acting (though admittedly it's hard to make Smith's hyper-cool dialogue sound spontaneous) and isn't terribly well plotted, but it's a reasonably entertaining film."
A1FEM0RA4M87GV_314,"A US and a Japanese soldier were marooned together on a Pacific Island . Only these 2 soldiers are in this WWII flick.
It is well done and filled with excitement. I know you will like it as I did."
A1KM9J57TJ65TC_11764,The best examination of the role of glider airborne actions in WWII available. It helps resolve questions of whether every glider campaign was a disaster.
A1KV4E3KRTAFBS_23052,"badly lit, badly edited, bad script, the actors may be perfectly good actors, but who could tell from this junk heap of aimless generic neuroses that substitute for characters"
A10CEZ872J7296_20296,"I feel like any time you add elements of time travel the movie gets cheesy real quick. That being said, the film was fun to watch."
A18758S1PUYIDT_14778,"OK, the goat horns on Borgnine are hilarious, but this is actually a very creepy story otherwise, with satan worshippers in the desert and a good cast."
A3UEWQUB9WC5CV_10308,"There are so few movies you can say this for, but this one is actually better than the book!"
A3V68W1ZX3EG2B_6130,"If you spent your teen years during the 70's, then buy this. You will not be disappointed."
A1L4A8IVRFE9KO_4597,"Great movie. A little long and drawn out in spots, but overall a really good movie."
A35YY0FL6T45H7_9464,"Fun to see all these actors together.  Although the storyline is based on a actual event, as presented in this movie it is somewhat thin."
A2QPA8K4SULRW2_22843,"Disappointed in this blu-ray. The format is the same, full screen not wide screen and it doesn't seem any clearer than the original.
I don't recommend buying the blu ray."
AUX0AAT25O9O0_5467,Great movie. Came brand new in wrapper. Played great no problems. Great buy. You can hardly find any good movies at WM.
A3GO7KI1G6Q7U6_18183,I guess there are worse ways to spend two hours. Basically a couples vanity film.
AYP7ICAF43JOF_5676,"1941 is a fun anti-war movie that seems to explode into a thousand pieces of crazy entertainment. This is a Steven Spielberg movie representing his brilliant creativity, early in his movie making career, seeing is believing, especially the submarine opening."
A30M9ME5AT8K12_17608,Not the one I thought it was. I think I was looking for the 53 or maybe the 38.
A1KULI5HW8BVMH_23679,"Loved it in Jr. High in the theaters, but 35 years later liked it more for nostalgia than the great story."
A29T1YK1BKEU29_21780,It did not play right. I am still trying to find a copy of this old movie.
ALBYA3BQOB12L_13862,"We all are not who we seem to be. Some show it all the time and some just are good in hiding it.
Real good life story."
A3G7WL27MW8QXI_12573,3 stars entirely for the psycho voice and the brilliant (camp) scene in the elevator...
A3I9VSHAVCCAUW_22709,I thought there would be a serious story line to this movie.  I did not expect a reality show comedy.  I threw it in the garbage after viewing it.
A2PAO34GEJXXCU_4517,This is a movie that can be watched periodically over the years and enjoyed over and over. It is based on classic themes of love and acceptance along with comedy mixed with serious dialog. It's one of my favorites.
A3NRGGPNGQA62F_23855,"Not so much.  If you are a Tarantino fan, you will probably like this movie, but if not.....  I appreciated the acting, but that's it."
A6QP1KJWRTSKK_13704,"If you like comedy you will love Robin in this movie version of Popeye. I don't think this is his best work, but it was fanciful and cute"
A14BZO2MMNMMAJ_12729,"Seeing it for the second time, there is no overlooking the weak script writing and far too convenient ""suspensions of disbelief"" required. But c'mon. It's Star Trek!"
A3HXGMHFM09UBX_16738,"Simple fun movie and not without some clever writing, still amusing to me after all these years.  Weird Al did a good job."
A2WIFALZ8KU03L_4632,"Great story telling.
Proves that abolitionist were mainly comprised of Christians and patriots, the same people that are now called bigots and racist"
A24G7L2JPZ04YY_21976,"Actually, I think it's very dumb. Time to move on people, and stop with the remakes. So ridiculous. After watching 10 minutes I had to delete it."
A33IGC3EDDL5R4_5998,"I absolutely love this movie, one of my favorites!  We received it in great condition & promptly.  The price was good too."
A2490GBIRZVVJT_3832,"Oh, I wish I could give it many more than five stars as one if the greatest classic movies ever spangled the silver screen. Frank Capra was just wonderful!"
AVOLG6APGYRYV_23112,Hard to understand.  Did this kid dream most of the movie? plot was hard to follow.
A1P30K8Q896XVG_7817,"This movie is the best and my favorite movie of all time. No matter how many times I watch it, it never gets old. I recommend to anyone who loves and wishes they had that fairytale."
A1PD1YTN74AY5C_3862,I REMEMBER NEIL DIAMOND FROM LONG AGO WHEN I STILL HAD MT 8 TRACK. HE'S GREAT IN THIS MOVIE. THE SELLER WAS QUICK AS A BUNNY...LOVE THAT TOO.
AYS6J5D1Z4CNT_10262,Not terrible but predictable. Acting ok but story skips some common sense items that would be done in real life.
A2WWB4U3DJBKFS_4389,"I love this movie that helped cause the I Dream of Jeannie series.  They rarely show it on TV, and I wanted it."
A3FBO09YBNU0AK_2777,This is a  hilarious and brilliant film for anybody who wonders about the relationship between the media and presidential elections.
A39ZAXL9RVZ5VR_19338,the cover looked better than the actually movie very disappointed but that how it is sometime some time you win sometime you lose it won't stop me from ordering more movies
A25CLT9ES9GWBZ_20135,"Not quit what I expected
It was actually far better than that
You kept wondering how it would turn out"
A1XJ2XSG4W96K8_21715,This movie is simply offensive! It would be better with Carlos Mencia or Bob Saget.
A23UZZ4BURPLQI_5653,"Ridiculous. No apparent plot, slapstick humor but not the good kind (i.e. Karl Marx). Didn't finish watching movie."
A3HIUJ0AQT9SRC_20229,"Absolutely terrible...I'd get my money back if I could as this is totally unwatchable...and I'm a long time Whovian...they portray the Doctor here as Human, and the inventor of the Tardis...talk about non-canonical..."
A29ZFNVG727RGU_20886,"Film quality wasn't bad, neither was it good.  The worst thing was the acting with portrayal of the characters.  There are a lot of 'Nutcrackers' out there - find another one."
A1IERUAGDIWZ7E_11533,"THIS MOVIE IS AWESOME !!!  IT'S UNRATED, LOTS OF GORE BUT IN A VERY FUNNY WAY. THERE'S AN UNCUT VERSION OF THIS FILM CALLED ""BRAINDEAD"", IT'S LIKE 8 MINUTES OF ADDED FOOTAGE INCLUDING MORE GORE  (!!!)."
A2EMV4R8DZG9PP_11400,"This version of the classic was sliced and diced and I have no idea why. It's not worth the postage to return it. I've purchased an unedited version, so this one goes in the recycle bag.

Tom"
A1TDF7GR8K2FJE_3743,"This movie is still great the second time around.  It is imaginative and well executed with an over the top villain, a first rate performance by Sean Connery, and a good science fantasy story line."
AZIZF7LTTD7Z_19234,"I'm a big fan of old movies and am very accepting of stories that, by today's standards, seem a bit silly. By Love Possessed is beyond silly. It's pure idiocy. A waste of some good acting talent."
A1WUDCNHB9QLH8_12862,Whimsical look at a youthful Holmes and Watson.  I watched this years ago and enjoyed the tale from start to finish.
A2GJ41GYVRWS35_20031,Entertaining.  Bought it because of a discussion and we couldn't find it to rent it anywhere.  Not horrible but it took us four times before we stayed awake to the end.
A1NSCSIPBOAQOI_12734,Awful. Watched half. Too silly and way out of date. The music was so outdated.
AW06TGCIAXYS2_19561,"Not as fun as or as good as Rocky Horror Picture Show! Brad and Janet are not the original actors sad to say. ''Little Black Dress'' best song. Worth having if you're a fan of Rocky Horror, but meh otherwise."
A1GSJ4TMAE2MYC_10269,Not the greatest horror movie ever made. But scary it most certainly is. Lance Henriksen from the Alien movies stars. And he's just plain creepy anyway. But like in Alien the monster steals the show!
AVF60NZ99H9D5_17292,"Very little that is funny or works here. Loved The Producers, though (1968 original version.)

Sorry, Mel. I know, comedy is tough to do. If it makes you feel any better, I think Sir Alfred is way
overrated."
A3KOV4NK6MD0WQ_16039,I wanted this movie for my collection and a movie is movie if you like or not isn't your choice
A1457AO7LV0B0O_8596,"Horrific. I remember seeing it when if first came out but I must have been distracted because I could not make it through the first 30 min,"
ABNVZASAPH33B_3734,What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said a gazillion times over?!  It's a Wonderful Movie!!
AIIME7ONS16GB_14993,I love all Jane Austen but I was expecting a miniseries like Pride and Prejudice in which all the dialog and plot twists were 100% faithful to the book and this did not do that.
A2S9J0ZOALNYFM_6457,"Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck are so good together, this movie shows a different side of each individual, testing their abilities."
A35MKR15IJGP3C_10681,Funny adult humor. I probably watch it more than 6 times and will continued to watch it again.
A3ENX1Y48DJQVK_11986,This was a good movie and following the effort of the mentally challenged man trying to make his way with much against him.
APH4EG6DRPMCT_6126,This is a classic.  You don't have to be a baseball fan to love it.
A3DOWGAPPRTJH4_17592,This movie is terrible.  I remembered the name from when I was young and it was cheap so I bought it having never seen it-mistake.
A1XRNZ1RAEIK4K_3334,"This is another Mel Brooks' classic!
He has made great movies, he is in his late 80's but i wish he would continue!"
A29F2MJ3IS5KHL_23938,"This movie was horrible, but had a few good scenes. Still, even the third Halloween movie was better then this one. Don't buy it or waste your time watching it...you'll most likely be disappointed."
A1AAXVBMX4MWVC_2050,Little Orphan Annie was my all time favorite funny strip. And now I can watch the musical anytime I want on my Kindle Fire.
ABRAU6KKBKF3O_9120,"Didn't care for this movie.  Typical ""will they get together?"" but not a lot of story line."
A1OM1HSFAA4VIR_6743,Unbelievably funny. You have to see this little jem again in the clear DVD version. I'm really glad I bought it.
AMNTZNZIAXI5O_7038,Did not work in my computer or DVD player skipped lines and stopped numerous times.  I gave up and returned it.
A1BQ0HTG3C53IH_145,A nice alternative to the classic. Can be used to get the point across but it is different that the Bible in some points
A3ITD2FDGPB5CR_12741,it was ok not what i was to expect it is an older movie there has been better movies out  there
A2JQV3DNBN3S3S_14075,Hated this version of Murder On The Orient Express. Slow moving and boring.  I finished watching it  but it was a chore to do so.
ADBWMU6AB5I8H_19405,This movie went no where and was a sleeper - it was really one of the worst movies I've watched in a long time.  Maybe because there just was no story - BORED TO TEARS or YAWNS I should say!!
A29JMAG6CLFPI3_14731,My granddaughter liked this movie when she was in high school.  A good influence and gave her the courage to be her own person .
A2Q713NUXIUNZ_6465,"I hated this movie! I told a friend I didn't care for it and the response was ""you just don't understand art"". I understood the movie, I just didn't like it.  So that's my review"
A1U9NCKU8OC3DQ_20123,The voice is not right - but the movie is great - The father knows everything and the mother know more and keeps the father confused-
A1FE8808JZGIK_956,"Yes, I replaced my VHS copy with this DVD.  Its a great movie that I watch from time to time."
A1TMWJUC1AMGQI_12962,"One of my favorite slightly older movies. Still relevant today. Odd no one has a cell phone, though."
A1CU40TOIGHYKN_14160,"It was a good old fashioned movie.  It reminds me of Gothic Novels, a little scary and creepy, but it ends nicely."
AC4EH29U5J5YK_6107,Is it a baseball movie or a romance.  I'll tell you - it's a damn romance movie.  Just because one of the characters plays baseball don't think you are getting a sports movie.
A2FQ1USWVZMPD8_6044,"The first time I watched this, I never liked it. But, when I found out who the disguised stars were, I caught on and enjoy the campy scenes."
AJ31BWRFU2W9Q_20635,"It moved too slow for me.  The ballet was good, but too long for me.  I didn't watch all of it."
AICZPVJNU6QBI_23857,"Problem, unlike the TV show and the first few Muppet movies, this film has way way too little Muppets and a pretty bad story too. Fie on Disney for this slop! No ale for them!"
A3TBQ1CSPV3XEZ_7597,Jodie is one of those rare actresses (actors included) who seems to have unlimited versatile talent and can perform in any role with amazing success. I love her! This movie is no exception.
A22LDKAIBLRLR4_15140,"Due to a misunderstanding of the item description on Amazon, I ordered it thinking it was something else.  I'm keeping it because a friend can use the tape as a master to copy onto a DVD."
AO714WX9TP32B_13971,to many of these made. Takes all the intrigue away. Gets ridiculous..you know what's going to happen next
A2QNTBKV8UQBC1_18345,"This is a very strange movie.  Excellent picture quality, the dvd is very well produced.  Crazy movie about crazy street people.  Not strong on plot, but a lot of bizarre effects."
A22P6AQNNFFQK1_10845,A good movie for fans of Peter Sellers. Makes you wonder if it really could happen... and hope it couldn't.
A2N6UZTNJNVS3A_5247,"Not only  Patrick Swayze but the supporting actors all make for the most interesting story.
The truck driving............since my father was a semi driver............I marveled at the expertise,
skill and camera work, scenery, everything of this ""thrill ride along"" saga."
A3V3SRIHAW1UHZ_18084,"The film is, of course, great.  Best film version of Hamlet IMHO!  But the quality of the video is poor, it's like a theater copy or something, and the sound kept dropping, slight stalls and skips..."
A3LCBP3779NWKL_5716,"What can a person say, but that this movie is a classic 80's movie.  Could watch it anytime.  Very good!"
A15LOW3MMZZZI9_16908,"Great movie, great Pacino and a really lurid subject matter rarely looked at. BUT, you must buy the DVD or Blu-Ray copy instead of this VHS."
A2RPPG5T4Z1GOA_7992,"Gave this for a gift, it was the same price in the store I just did want to go to the store to get it, ordered it with several other gifts.  Great movie!!!"
A2ZD8IT06D1FCK_5385,Love this movie. It shows all of us that possessions do not matter. It's people. As always great service with a quality product. Amazon is where I feel comfortable with them and their sellers
A3F9UOWJ4NXRIE_20814,"This is such a predictable and boring movie that not even my husband, which was very much into the A-team, wanted to finish watching.
Don't loose your time."
AB393KMNI492M_20775,One of John Wayne's best.  His role as a family man is different from most of his portrayals.
A1YK31V8N02IFS_740,Always love a good classic and with clearer picture quality than VHS this is a definite trip down memory lane.
A1GUMWHGSEBDS5_3771,"This will always be the best version of a timeless classic.  Black & white or color, it does not matter...the message is powerful either way.  (Personally, I prefer the original black & white...it just seems ""right"")"
A1QWUMKPPJUOYA_1464,"To get the movies in steel book is definitely worth doing, especially if you are a fan of steel book case collecting!"
A29TC0PCTFQ7XI_9839,"Even though you can figure out how this story will go, i found it still enjoyable. I was a bit disappointed at the end which rather seems to just cut off your left wondering, ""That's it?"""
A6EH58AKFHXTH_2201,"a great movie for the man cave, you will not be disappointed, and I would  highly recommend it to anyone."
A3UHL49TJVGE4S_10450,"Very disappointed. I love Sidney Poiter but this movie bored me to death. I expected it to be more like the series, ""In The Heat of the Night"" which I really love."
A2GSC84FVSIJ8W_14825,The only redeeming factor of this movie is FF.  All the rest is stupid and boring.
A2JMI5PI572LB6_14357,"George C. Scott in his crowning role, with a great supporting cast. One of the great performances. Good story, passable special effects."
A127KB3M6UQFL6_3198,"obsesses with sex, which gets tedious quickly unless you are also obsessed with sex (I'm not)."
A5RIJP083P20Q_15602,"The content is 4 star, but the packaging is 1 star.  They really need to come out with better packaging for the original series.  I'd love to see some commentary or bloopers added, too."
A3VQSFORKH8B7O_11413,"This is a good film full of heart and soul! Great performances and a fine story! Filmed in the lucious Blue Ridge Mountains of Cherokee, North Carolina! Worth the price! Grade: A+"
A3QDHY8XXAOV2U_15824,"Similar to the first video, I had a hard time completing this video when I did it for the first time. However, I was quite disappointed with it because it is nothing like the first video."
A1RMYNFQMBIYC8_20912,it was  ok  not what i remembered it to be from the past but better than the show on tv
A3IZQWRULAKKMT_6778,With a cast like those two don't expect anything but funny action. We enjoyed every minute of the movie. Itis a good bet you will enjoy the movie.
A3TXFJB5M5RG3V_22833,"I never finished this movie, there was something in the first 15 minutes that did not grab my attention at all.  I wish I could give a more complete review, I know others have found this very well liked."
A27TMU9HWUHG5X_11241,Cinematography and location shots were great. Equal in scope and dynamic compare to even todays digital imaging. This is a outstanding classic.
A34P3QC23N0HZX_10220,"Peter Sellers really gets the job done in this film. A lot of elites and the like claim this is the best Jacques Clouseau film and while I don't agree, that may be splitting hairs."
A3LMP4R448BRKG_11414,My four year old grandson didn't like it. Wouldn't watch it again.  I watched this movie when I was a kid and it was boring then.
A19U8NGKXOY5T1_4642,"Outstanding story telling. Magnificent performance by several great actors, with the Anthony Hopkins at his best. Must watch movie."
A2WHSKDSV2FHIE_3803,"A must have for Diamond fans!
Check out the movie that goes with this sound track too!"
A34RW2KH2ZQSNT_2813,Thank you so very much for this great movie; I love it!  I will be sharing it with my friends.
AXDXTS6IW6NH3_13630,"Really Good show.
Not the best special effects, but it is not new & not high budget.
Good story line & not typical ""They all lived happily ever-after....."""
A398C7O685VR18_9680,Probably my least favorite season. There are some strange episodes exploring Ferengi and other cultures. Everything seems to be building toward the next season.
ATOYU6QSA7E1T_3425,"I'm a diehard John Wayne fan, and this western combined action and a nice little love triangle on the side.  I've watched this one many times, and always enjoyed it."
A2MN44T0P4KERI_15819,"You never see this movie on the cable movie channels.  That is too bad,  Even the bad guys get some sympathy."
A1819LV5G8OI6I_804,LOVE IT. EVERYTIME I WATCH IT I GET ADDICTED. I AM ALMOST AS BAD AS MY MOTHER.
A1D5EI2RP526N3_11303,"Not as good as Heston, but it was a gift.  Arrived on time but I did not watch it...Sent it on."
A2IQ9J9SSXHG0Z_4939,"Excellent movie, seen in preparation for her upcoming new book. I certainly got more out of it than I did 40 years ago!"
A3J88M8V5YHLV7_22970,"Sorry, I expected better, but must realize it was filmed in 70's, but acting is good. Storyline was a bit contrived I thought."
A3RK1Y6G71Q4N8_19286,"I remember enjoying this on its release, but time is not its friend. You can see why Van Dam was destined to become a star though; and for that alone it's worth watching."
A28GIZR0CHZBIX_15173,"Very good Movie, other than a lot of facts seem to be inaccurate, however the cast is super, and the action scenes are as well."
A1DCSKLPH1G2TF_12816,Can't say as I like the Director's Cut. Though I would give the theatrical release 5 stars.
A1PNQ4F0UC9V4_12259,I had never seen the movie before and I was really disappointed but thank you..
A1HBRMO4GD50X_14607,"This did not stand the test of time. It is worth your time though, at least once. It's just a bit too absurd about a serious subject for me. Very goofy movie."
A3E7F7YJPBKMWT_7242,"This film dedicated to Charlie Chaplin is very accurate and truly amazing. Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Chaplin and he portrays the kindness, dramatic, and hilariousness of Chaplin through the ages."
ALK2WX65YH7KG_18849,"I found this movie entertaining and, with Marilyn's portrayal, very sexy. Tom Ewell was at his funniest and the perfect actor for this role."
ACQFS9JNHMFBZ_19022,"Wooden script with cartoon characters.  Acting is surprisingly bland, but the characters are not given much to work with."
A2A1AJO2GNTG6W_18284,"This movie is so politically wrong it is a waste of time. There is a more accurate film, title the same, that details the Crimean war. Errol, once again, is the hero."
A2208E747MXAQ3_16999,"A great movie that I saw as a child. Time has not dimmed its appeal and I have been to Salem, Mass!"
A2KXC33ZDH90Z6_16733,I originally saw this movie when i was a child. A lifetime later it still has a great appeal to me. Worth a watch
A1JFGDISIXWO3H_7274,"Rollicking good fun. One of my favorite Schwarzenegger movies because of the combination of original storyline, action, and humor."
AM63A7UC2AXVE_8478,A gripping movie. It gave me an insight in the struggle the Irish had in getting their independence from the British.
A2GHAAIKFYTFY1_21137,"I love Kevin, but this movie was too long, very forgettable, too many cobbled together scenes.  I had seen it before and could hardly remember any of it."
A2J93JPZCRHYZ8_345,"It is always sad to hear, read, and or see how the World War I and II impacted people's lives.  Learned a bit more of history watching this show."
A2REDULZIBLOTB_3471,"was boring & I stopped the movie part way through , disappointed in the actors !"
A19QXCL2LQJ9JY_14105,"Simply put, this movie is a waste of time. It is self-indulgent sixties nonsense produced by movie-makers with too much hubris and not enough sense."
A3T4YO43IBJ7MC_10865,This movie I really like.  the DVD was recently purchased to replace the VHS copy I had.  I am doing that with several of my VHS movies.
A1JFYPC4M406KL_13094,"This is an old John Wayne movie, made a few years after Stagecoach.  It's exciting and entertaining, of course, and Gabby Hayes adds even more humor"
A1EU66488BUQC2_18455,"Definity not a 4-5 star movie.  I give it one extra star since there was a couple scene that were ""ok""."
A1W2JAZXUVWUBZ_1451,"I believe we have all the resident Evil movies so you no we had to have this one as well, action packed awesome thank you for my movie it arrived on time and as described"
A1L6P93E67OOKS_20076,COMPARED THIS BLURAY SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE DVD.NOT GREAT BUT IT IS CLEANER AND WORTH THE MONEY IF YOUR A FAN OF THE MOVIE.
A3FP0Q1G4L2FJ1_5450,"A just for fun movie.  Maybe a few things are a little exaggerated, but that just makes for a good story line."
A2REHQ4HRG4HP4_11632,"Fun no brainer.  Lots of over acting.  Good for a rainy day, afternoon movie if you have nothing else to do."
AH0RSR1MUZDYE_8134,"This was one of my daughters favorite moves when she was about 3.  I think the movie was fun (but not great) however she loved the sound track and now loves Elvis music, go figure."
A34O1FHEAN9DN6_3583,"Great movie, very good sound and image on this DVD. Too bad there no substantial extras. Will this movie ever gets the full, genuine special edition it deserves?"
A1B8KYG1W1744D_2784,"do not like any of the house party movies but a niece does so i give it 1 star and my niece gives it four stars, she like all of them"
A2ENPEJU8AJNU6_23009,"I don't really like this movie.  Kinda like a Home Improvement TV show for 2 hours.  Boring and predictable, even for small children."
A2CHH5U12THP2D_17593,"Boring!  Richard Burton was really miscast as Alexander. I think it's best to have actors who are from another country rather than trying to make popular actors fit these part in the big production.
Burton as a blond was horrifying."
AX5ZFU92MGAZB_21380,"I love all these actors but this one was just so weird. It was hard to like the characters, very whiney and self-absorbed. Kudos for off beat and creative. Definitely not mainstream Worth a watch."
AH06UFDUCQLUI_1204,on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much
A2L8829SSFQZ6U_17814,very 80's the voice of the mouse was strangely irritating.....if i recall i didn't like it when it first came out.....oh well 2 stars for the effort put into the project
A1XKIR7F6E4OJ6_13706,I didn't see this in the 80's so I thought it would be fun to watch.  I can't believe this movie was so popular.  It was short and disappointing.
A6UXKR93WH9WO_16600,"It was a great third installment, however the second one is still my favorite.  You do get to see Mr. Miyagi kick some ass in it again though."
A1XRPOP6G5U537_17510,"It is not nearly as boring as the 2001, A Space Odyssey. It made it's point, but still pretty weird. It's out there."
A1EM4RTS8T5PA8_13133,A great story about finding oneself and love as well.  Still relevant although a bit dated...
A3DW7E9WDUC1SX_19078,"The DVD arrived damaged.  I returned it for a ""refund"" which was handled quickly.  The movie itself was very good until it would no longer play."
A2RBS3KEBWJ4RX_15703,Great acting by Streep and Nickolson. Shows us the harsh reality that anyone from any back ground can get on the wrong path.
A6QYHVZR22JP5_19593,Got it and it was in Spanish. Returned it and got not even 50% of my payment back. Not happy...
AQB1BHS1N9GPH_14715,Good pace and not much out of what's recorded in the books about Rommel. Hollywood left it's fantasyland bs out of this movie.
A2TQIHRK7JNDCA_2423,"This was a pretty good movie a little slow in some spots, but the story was good."
A3M88RCAR2T804_12353,I can't wait for this movie to come out on DVD.  I watch this movie every time it comes on TNT or WTBS or whatever station.  Dennis Weaver does an excellent job in this one man movie.
AYR9QV34HR56W_23787,Bought it because I like Steve McQueen  movies but this isn't his best by far. Not worth owning unless you are a collector.
A2HWIBVFNYVA1X_5050,What can I say. Great performance and a great story that will hold your attention all the way through. Black and White is a great format for this semi-dark work.
A3NRHO869902K4_8279,"This is a must-have movie, especially if you have little girls who love princesses. I still like to watch this movie when it comes on ABC Family, but it's also great to have my own version!"
A3NKVC51L4XVWB_7930,"Oh, you already know what our favorite scene was, and what song is apt to be sung when I tell grandkids it's time to help clean up the house."
A3JQ58CZBV3FOZ_9923,"The movie starts out with some good ideas, but in the second half, after the plot has been revealed, the director keeps the action going mostly by having the good guy make stupid moves. The dramatic tension dissipates quickly."
A3FOSBM4MMUFER_20753,"I know I watched this film, but I can't remember a thing about it.  That almost makes me want to view it again ... almost."
A3HB9AJ2HYGUVZ_4560,I love Patrick Swayze and heard this was a great movie I am sure I am going to love it
A2JEODPINTZWX0_21112,"There are many better family movies. ""Camera Angles"" and attire are done on purpose i think. Story line very very predictable."
A3L3B81RJIDO56_13406,"I was a little disappointed in this Movie, but I guess for the time it's okay.  I did watch the whole Movie, but the special effects are very dated.  ALC"
A21A17T3TG912R_2266,"I AM WRIGHTING THIS FOR MY BROTHER,TANNER.HE WATHED THIS MOVIE 7 TIMES THE FIRST DAY HE GOT IT!HE`S A BIG ELMO FAN AND THIS IS HIS FAVORETE ONE!HE LOVES THIS MOVIE AND I KINDAVE LIKE IT TO!"
A2ROO8DKI0K542_9546,"I watched this version many years ago and liked it a lot then now it's, ok. The intro music seems wrong for a murder mystery movie."
A2TFHD8YI0OA2J_14367,"Never seen Moira in anything before, but I loved her in this. This film has it all: romance, tragedy, comedy...a bit bizarre at times but wonderful nonetheless."
AZS0ZRC1ZR4MX_6869,It is a crazy movie alright but we are disappointed that Christian Bale would take on such a movie.  Will not recommend to others.
AHCOHPEJGL2V2_15126,"I was impressed with the footage of the film. It is a real treasure to preserve, reminds me of the newsreels when I was s kid."
A2XS69IHBWW6SI_881,"This purchase was great and the service was excellent, as always. I am very pleased. Fast service and exactly what I expected."
A2SOOG4P7TLAO9_22921,They all look great but what in the world were they thinking with the plot? Such great actors and this is what they come up with? The best thing about the movie are their classy outfits.
A2R04RVGKGL1Z6_5895,I've always liked this movie. The cast was excellent and the story line well paced.
A2SQWM7T75MEC_17879,The DVD arrived on time and was in good shape. Played it the next night and it quit about half to three quarters of the way thru. Not sure what to do about it.
A2WS03A3HFMCI6_19406,"This movie got good reviews and am still trying to figure out why.  There was no story line, no particular plot and was not particularly interesting.  Wasted time as far as I'm concerned!"
A1SO4ARF3DUM3C_6547,"Delivered in a few days
Brand new as promised
A real bargain too
A personal ""thanks"" from the seller too"
AJ7Z4XMSI3RSB_18476,This must be the rut that no one wants - the movie takes some weird turns as it tries to catch the magic of the first and second movie.
A1HUVGRO6ZJWNI_3731,"This is a movie from the old black and white days that everyone loves. Jimmy Stewart in despair, rising above it. A wonderful family movie for the Christmas season."
A2YM6JTQIBZ8YC_11960,The first three tapes are entertaining and informative. The forth sews up things too quickly and gives no information on the Pack the their later years. A fifth tape would have been excellent.
A2YL7MJ439CFCZ_12875,"Not much entertainment in this movie at all. The use of the detectives name is purely for populating the viewership, as well."
A16QY64BVV4A1X_9184,Matthew Broderick does a good job in his role.  The best part about the movie is the character development and heroism of Broderick's character.  Well worth watching!
AIN84UNXQUFLK_12322,"Possibly the origination of what we call ""Road Rage"" today, this old video pits a car (driven by Dennis Weaver) against an unknown assailant in an 18-wheeler. Great entertainment for back then ..."
A3KKYCZ0CZ453X_10678,"The movie is entertaining in parts but not as a whole. The end was abrupt. Watchable, but only if you have nothing else to watch."
AU81CNP0YW8G_7943,We love this delightful movie for both it's story and it's music.  Great cast and we enjoy the references to past Disney classics.
A1FZEP0PZLG25Y_18870,"WATCHED IT ONCE AND WILL NEVER WATCH IT AGAIN- GAVE IT AWAY TO GOODWILL FOR SOME OTHER POOR SOUL TO WATCH. POORLY ACTED, DIRECTED AND VERY GORY."
A1751JOJFVXE5Y_16089,"can't beat price.  I almost have entire collection.  Yeah their cheesy but come on, cha cha cha cha  Jason is coming for you!"
A8NTLDAEGCYR1_20738,"continuation of the classic, if you liked 1 and 2, give this one a shot."
A13KYIV76C9ZWO_9550,"Watched the original 1845 version first, and this one came off like a cheap TV version with inferior cast and poor acting"
A210CHUAF1CGU1_10457,"An old movie that was fun to watch again! There were some scenes that I had completely forgotten, and the sound effects compared to today's standard were a little weak. Still a good movie to watch!"
AL1WE3X62YC3T_21941,It's awful. Don't waste your time with anything from these yahoos. I chose it by mistake and I want that 15 minutes of my life back.
A29IZYCZFQVMGU_5820,Turned it off after the first fifteen minutes!  Was mortified that this movie was rated G!  I fear I have caused potential nightmares for my child!
A3CQ4B69W6ZI6V_23634,I am a rabid Peter Ustinov fan but even he can't save this bomb. Dumb. Not funny. A waste of time.
A6A836XK0QM2W_15696,A fine crime film with great acting but a little too much time spent in the trucks.
AMWC81F6KKKCA_6581,"This movie makes you think no matter your gender, age, or life situation. It is very symbolic and super deep."
A1QF9JR5S88TFS_19766,"NOT THAT GREAT, NOT EXACTLY LE CARRE'S MATCH. HAVE READ LOTS OF LE CARRE'S BOOKS.  EXPECTED MORE FROM THIS.  WISH I COULD GET MY MONEY BACK."
A2I837L8G30QHB_21229,This tale of a movie production gone awry stopped being funny after about 15 minutes worth of failures. You could pass it by; I wish I had.
A82Q2SP65Y14X_9844,didn't get what i thought id get ill probably give it away if you like old stuff you'll like this but that old stuff is so predictable
A1W59BUVVMP4UL_4460,"Based on real life Tuskegee human experimentation, this movie should be included in medical and nursing school curricula and discussed at every team planning on doing or reviewing human research."
A1GJ5I1Y45WV7I_19477,An interesting look into the daily trials and tribulations of what one might encounter in the event of taking on the responsibility of a position that even sometimes training does not equip you for. Good for the collector!
A130YXZ5FZ1X0M_21912,"Bought for a friend.
Remake of a classic.
My friend loved it, I however did not get to view it at all."
A30WFYKC1210LA_10968,"I bought this for my grandson but he needs to be a bit older to understand it.  That's ok, its wonderful stories that teach the Word of God."
A7QKG8NXOR7W0_14425,This is a unique movie.  I like it because it is different and the idea of this happening to you is terrifying. How do you fight off something you can't see?
A2NLL8X7KOHIXL_10798,WHEN WATCHING AN OLDER MOVIE ON BLURAY ITS JUST A LITTLE BETTER THAN DVD... BUT A GOOD COMPONENT TO YOUR STARWARS COLLECTION
A2LUIR3SGJ967C_12448,Really overpriced for what is offered.  The Sinatra track is the really the only one worth watching.  Baryshnikov is not interesting when talking.  He's sheer magic when dancing.
A2QEWZDQOHBKCV_20322,"Honestly it's not a bad movie. It's just that sometimes you're really confused as to why some characters are doing what they're doing. Plus, the twists and turns you experience aren't all that thrilling either. But still, not terrible."
A1O25RJH2WXI2Z_10886,"STILL HILEROUS AFTER ALL THE YEARS, BUT VERY CLOSE TO WHAT REALLY DID HAPPEN, AND I WAS IN ONE OF THE TANKERS, DOING THE REFUELING,"
AKQ3N1LXAP6SL_12966,"Sticks and Skips- I haven't had a dvd mess up like this in  years.  I can't print a label , so I guess I won't be able to return it."
A25KKXUQQ0OLWB_221,I wasn't so thrilled with this show as a kid and I guess I'm still not.  It lacks the excitement and warmth of some of the other Rankin Bass shows from the 60s.  It's Ok though.
A36KJYDBSISU8W_9983,"It is a classic adventure movie. Action, humor, a young Han Solo, no really Ford can do more that one character. Just one to dust off and watch again."
A1UZDDOYS240ZV_4439,One of THE best pick-me-up movies I've ever seen. I just had to get it! It has such a sweet message to it and amazing moments.
A25CKZXB7GLCO6_3505,"Great, I enjoyed receiving it on time ...keep up the god work...  It came on time and as it was described"
ASIX14IFP5BH6_15003,"This is an excellent movie.  In spite of it being somewhat dated the topic is still relevant.  Imagine a government that... wait, that would be telling.  Just watch it.  If you don't like it, well, you will like it!"
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_6407,"Boris Karloff in The Original, it is not a Horror movie in the ultimate sense but it is worth watching As Only Karloff can Deliver and the eerie face and look adds to The Mummy."
A2U1HG5997AK62_20207,"This may have been an actual theatrical release, but from like 1965... I was only able to get through like the first 20 minute before loosing interest.."
ATOAYL20ZUE5E_19457,"The war would profoundly change anyone and the news you were dying as well, but there was something lacking in Greer Garson's acting altogether.  Perhaps it was the divorce ordeal she went through."
A345WVAVMMO6F0_16246,"while two sisters grow old, their ""servant"" makes a big dinner. um, i know I'm not describing it very well, but if you're interested enough to see this movie, you've probably already seen it."
AQ8SX9HLM8KFW_23916,Not a good movie.  Plot not to good and it dragged on.  Not one James Garner better movies.
AZABW35W1T2S1_8080,I purchased this digital download for my grandson and he loves it...he watches it over and over again.
ACQT14ZN20YQY_8247,I purchased this movie for the kids. They love the movie and I recommend it to others with children or adults with that inner child! Was a OEM movie and not a knock off.
A18EY641PIFQ3V_11833,This was an older movie so the quality of the picture was poor. The plot was very predictable and some of the acting was not what I expected from the stars featured in it.
AX0NP95STC5IX_2520,"A lot of people liken this to a conspiracy theory movie, but the story is good and the technology exists. Makes you think."
A36105TNLQVS5W_21708,"Criticized as the worst of the prequels I still needed it to complete my set. I only give it one star because of the movies content, not a faulty product."
AIZFFX5GEZ0YI_9822,"Good war story line and dating plot with good lessons for teenagers.  Model ships were used in battle scenes, but no gore or foul language which makes it suitable for all ages."
A2IDU0AHILRCV9_13798,"Gave as Christmas gift. Not sure what else to say. I had already seen this film, so I knew about it. Gave it to a family member as a gift."
A8JQE26ZSFVM9_9042,It was kind of hard to watch for me.  It is made for a younger crowd.  I was just thinking of the overcrowding and extreme situations that the movie shows.
A3U5RC83IITZLQ_14243,"I was in the mood for a good attack fish movie.  The story line here is a good one and found myself cheering for a killer whale!  As a family, we enjoyed it."
A36JN7CKOPEQAF_5479,"but this is presented so that a child can watch and have an understanding........I bought it for the grandkids, but haven't watched it with them yet..........Not sure whether it will hold their attention..........."
A35PVWSPSWH16I_2073,My wife and I were pleased that we were able to find the complete series of Rumpole of the Bailey.  The set is reasonably priced and of good quality.
A3HLAVKQEANWP3_21127,Not one of my favorite Gary Daniels movies.  His movies seem to be hit or miss and this one was pretty much a miss.
A1X6NPS275ZGKS_16158,You will enjoy watching this movie.  It is one you will enjoy sharing with others.
A1GRKX99EFHS3C_8795,Just watched the new one. I saw this one a long time ago.  It is good. Not as exciting as the new one no CGI or anything of course.
AT3LXU3A66BOQ_9867,This is another in a long line of military movies featuring John Wayne and it (like the others) is a classic.
A3KOMFLNUGQTWZ_8811,Note to self...never ask what's in the box. One of my favorite movies. Not sure what I can write that hasn't already been said about this movie.
A2ZHAN3F2ABZN1_4549,"Good movie, bad disc. Was brand new but stops in certain spots and can't get past unless you skip a chapter."
ARGIK851WHJF4_5554,Bruce Lees' Life Story is told in this Film. It is well done & accurate. A must See for Bruce Lee Fans.
A23VM6TJ5QJUA8_12475,THIS MOVIE TURNED OUT NOT TO BE ONE ABOUT BURT GOING ON A FAST DIET AND GETTING REALLY SKINNY.
A1IX1D5QUM6ZQ6_5556,"Best go back some years movie of the Brat Pack , love the fact parts are Ad lib makes it more natural."
AXMRVTIJKIEC0_17075,"Sadly pretty hokey.  Just a long way from today's movies or even most of yesterday's movies.  Acting not so great, story was weak.  A B movie at best.  Kills a couple hours when you're tired."
A2FCLSRJMQB20F_18741,"I wanted this in dvd, not vhs! Somehow, I got a VHS, instead of a DVD.. A good movie, it is; but, not what I wanted.."
ASH07EY7KRVU0_7954,"Decent show, good animation the plot is straight forward if not entirely predictable but its a decent show none the less. Parents will be able to tolerate but don't expect to be enthralled."
A22S7O22IU1N3B_18334,DVD stopped playing about half way through.  I am checking to see if it can be returned.
A2SWZB0B8TYBA1_2775,Still one of the funniest satires around! And like a good satire there is truth and comedy.
A3O6DHWU0OW3PD_12707,"It was ok, a lot of blood, kind of fake. you cannot tell me you would not hear that bear coming from a long ways off."
A2W48L5D44LAQ8_22466,"Mildly humorous at best. Maybe it's supposed to be a drama. Maybe I don't get it. You should borrow or rent it first, if all your friend are talking about it."
A922OBI9W2W73_22870,Too slow. EVERYBODY is a bad guy. The mystery man turns out to be Kevin Spacey. Everybody else gets killed.
A55DWAFXRTZXG_404,Thanks for the outstanding job in keeping and sending this video in perfect shape . I will enjoy it for many years to come. ART
A3GPISNWREGKIA_12623,A ridiculous load of hokum. Looks like a typical Republic Picture. Who ever heard of that female lead? Awful looking with a terrible singing voice. Wayne should stick to Westerns. Remember that mess he made called Ghengis Khan?
A29HOQ02CF2UDJ_10630,This was a movie that I bought for my dad it was good for a 70's movie I liked it!!!!
A1E6ZVOM66BK7Q_22965,this was a good and actually for the time and era a well made movie. I was very pleasantly surprised to see the baseball great Lou Gerhrig( spelling may be incorrect)
A12CQA5018I3Y3_19560,"The ""humor"" in this movie was too sadistic for my taste, particularly Peter Sellers as a father who adopts a son to be a kind of slave/bodyguard for him, and Alec Guinness as a blind butler making pathetic mistakes."
A1M6T1LJ6OCSQS_23130,It talk about author book. I guess. He not remember what happen. But other man make him remember it. Smile.
A12NG64J2BCQS7_22554,So what happened to Ashley Bacon's poor cat?? Sandra Bullock only fed it one day on like Christmas Eve and it was left locked in that apartment for a month! Did Sandra Bullock let that poor cat starve to death??
A3FSOSQN8QNYZ3_11597,"Chinese Box is a big disappointment.
I couldn't get thru it.
have your time and rewatch ""Bosch""!
JK"
A1TGUHYWXQLGBR_2936,"This movie was a very good story but, why can't they leave out all the damn cussing.  I mean it was a good story until they started cussing every few words."
A2IVBTJ4LN686V_22404,"If you're looking for Academy awarding winning romance, this isn't it. BUT it's great fun and watching Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan's chemistry develop is an interesting ride. All with the beautiful backdrop of France."
A3SYF5OR2KAOKS_3384,"Wonderful Film-one of the best among the first two hundred best films of the last century. Very happy to own a copy!
Easy choice.
Very fast delivery.
Peter Berger"
A34FXKFLR733NM_13370,This has got to be the worst book-to-film adaptation of all time. Great book. Terrible movie.
A3FVMWJJPRE15U_16791,"Not one of Erik Estrada's top performances...although I said I thought it was OKAY, it was not as strong as his other works."
A3Q6NUVD5GHPQT_18177,"The fine print stated (after) I bought it, was that this DVD wouldn't play on American DVR players...they were right. Bad choice. I won't do that again.
 And since I opened it, I couldn't return it..."
A103WYBAWMAA59_18251,Some impressive cinematic pyrotechnics with wonderful performances from top talent can't save the flimsy script - this is a light work primarily for cinephiles.
A8546OC77MSEX_14707,"more seriously executed than some films in the genre, but still wonderfully bad.  i enjoyed it and would recommend it if you can find a cheap copy."
A2N8KENWGP8HV0_14122,"ok movie but this is definitely a case of ""who you know""
best picture of 1980!? i don't think so...boring character portrayals. And sleeper screenplay...and I've seen hundreds of drama movies."
AVUXRVOONT6ZW_6140,this is  one of my favorite jean-claude van damme movies  its a great action pack movie one of his great movies . I have been looking for this one as well. He is one of my favorite actors.
A1U5BW2WGD6Y2I_2860,"I wanted to like this movie because of the cast, but it was bizarre.  The main character's search for faith is unfortunately forfeited at the end of the movie - it was disappointing!"
A16C6BVQTTLHIZ_4341,It was Ok. I didn't expect Kanye West to be good as the commander of the Russian troops but he did a decent job.
AAVN1O3RMINQL_23958,a second grade movie not worth the time. You would be better off playing some mobile game rather than wasting time with this one.
A1I3CIHCDHXJ2C_8839,"When this movie first came out, seeing it in a theater made it oh, so creepy and dark. It just doesn't have the same effect anymore, but Brad Pitt was super hot!"
A3T5T1WQOUK5FW_11793,"Disappointed by the ranting diatribes.  This, I know, is his shtick, but he has also brought insight and wit in the past.  Alas, no such thing.  Just an angry older man carrying on about the same-old-same-old."
A6WHUZTO7V1DD_14573,"I did not read the title properly, this is Game of Death 2, and I wanted the original, it's a OK movie but not what i really wanted, but like I said it's OK to have in my collection."
A3PQ7URBN6JY34_23543,"Very disappointed in this movie, especially James' uniform. I found his uniform to be quite annoying. Did not care for the plot, very depressing movie."
A1D79P8RIESO8Y_170,This film was expertly directed and brought out many good points of the history of Joseph. I would highly recommend this disk to anyone.
ACO0WFIX771R9_2998,"Jackie is the man this is a great one, also get police story new police story and super cop all great movies"
A2QKMKK7EFVOYQ_3491,"GREAT MOVIE!! Johnny Depp is fabulous!!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE AND THE MOVIE ""TRAFFIC"".....IF YOU LIKE ONE .....YOU WILL LIKE THE OTHER!!  ENJOY!!"
A27IHUP0U9R1B9_11819,There is nothing beginning about this DVD set.  I was really disappointed.  The instructor is way beyond advanced and does nothing to help the beginning yoga student.  I sent my DVDs back in for a refund.
A591T7Y696C2Q_22788,"Holy smoke! This movie is awful! Scriptwise, actingwise and everything  else........just awful. Who wants to go see a movie about some snobbish,  clueless, wealthy teens?"
A3IB00J6CM5OLW_12767,"Hey all,

The movies from amazon are always of great quality. The movie is gripping alright but not as intriguing as hitchcock's other ones like spellbound, man who knew too much and many others.

Definitely worth a watch once,"
A3767ISGW1FBXC_5055,"This movie has to be seen, words alone just won't do. Every child should be shown this movie during the summer following 8Th grade and then again during their 11th and/or 12Th grade in school."
A335VKPVRMDX0L_20771,"Maybe if you're a teenage girl this would be a good movie, otherwise don't waste your time."
A17PJY5YTUU799_12451,I knew nothing about her life beyond her albums.  A fascinating and of course tragic story.
A2D6VDR54FDOK1_5053,"It was a magnificent movie Gregory Peck did a superb job of acting. I dd  see the movie when it was first released. Now that it was put on a DVD, I bought it."
A2LUAMVMG2QDSQ_8780,"I revisited this movie after seeing the original in theaters ages ago. Although time has made some of it kind of silly looking, the heart of the story stands solid."
A8X8D4BUY5DFU_2688,"Really great comic opera. Great singing, sets, and costumes, make for a great evenings entertainment without going out."
A2EEAP46EBTUSP_22496,"This is a pretty unmemorable episode. It works well, especially in the beginning, with the notion of an entire planet being cloaked, and the impressive technology within. Once the children are abducted, it starts getting kind of boring, though."
A3LZUPNX06NXHB_8075,I saw this film as a teenager (I'm 81 now) and loved it.  I still love it!
A38XKUIZMCUNCM_9678,"Love Titanic and love the blu-ray version, however disappointed that digital copy is only for i-tunes.  I don't use apple products and definitely not i-tunes.  Wish they gave you a couple options..."
A2IPZ12S0NU8C9_20270,"This is a great series of movies, but I liked the 1st one the best. Who does not like John Travolta. It is a funny movie but I recommend watching all three of them to get the best laughs."
A2UV8NASPTNGLX_2808,it was a life changing transaction that will forever change me and shall have deep meaning for my connection with Amazon and everyone affiliated with such a grand company
A3796QIKD42KKA_12454,Other Side of the Mountain 2 was a little boring compared to The Other Side of the Mountain. It was still a good movie though.
ATCBBOEYVR37I_19197,Only minutes into the video and I'm ready to stop viewing the nonsense and pseudo science or even more to the point the non-existence of any science that actually is evident in the nonsense claimed.
A115X7RPG5SW1Q_6086,This is one of my favorite movies.  Classic music and entertaining characters.  This is a movie I can watch over and over.  I will not review the plot since you can find that information on IMDB or elsewhere.
A3HRD4DJIA0Y1_14150,Competent. I could sit through the whole thing but it wasn't particularly memorable in any way.
A3RUG3HTP1Q0L_12301,"Typical of it's time, this TV movie was only fair. If you do wish to see it, catch in YouTube among other Marvel features."
ANPIN95RYM3H_18121,"if I remember right this was their worst rated movie and their last. Its not a really a comedy it contains horrible acting,dumb music but the only thing that its good at is wasting your time."
A1Y33MJ9XJK0Q6_11659,just received this product in the mail and look forward to watching it. I have always enjoyed this movie and have been looking forward to it for some time
A3IH9JAPOIXMHC_7475,This is a wonderful story of friendship and love. Great for young ones to watch. Fun for the whole family.
A3UAL0PZWVC9UV_16076,"It follows the formula and continues to lose quality. I enjoy these films for nostalgia's sake and this was me still delivers that for me. The telekinesis angle is neat, but out of place here for some reason."
A267IXCC7UK1HY_14763,"Hilarious, clever, feel-good romantic comedy.

I thoroughly enjoyed this romantic comedy. The leading couple were very attractive, the plot clever, the pace fast. Don't miss the movie."
A3NGL3JD7LQZSQ_8956,I believe this was the directors cut and didn't have the narration on the film.
AVWMM4EQCZFRE_20778,"Not my best, but now a part of my Shakespeare collection, albeit on the other side of the blanket."
AB7D0JCXCAQJX_970,This is a great blast from the past. They don't make movies like this anymore. Share with  your kids and grandkids!
A2BZRU1B3DY7BX_10694,"The second disc, Robocop 2 was defective and would not play at all, so I am giving this set 2 stars.

For MGM to release this with a known defective disc is inexcusable."
A1ME2EG5IY57XA_12999,This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen!  DO NOT waste your valuable time!
A1Y8BMHBRBINCO_19516,"Since kids tend to not notice bad acting and scripting as much, it's fine for them...but if parents are watching it with the kid, they should  discreetly put in ear buds and listen to an audio book until it's over."
AH91ZJ8W8NCLR_20115,"Sound is not normalized; one minute too quiet, next minute way too loud!!!  Thus, I watch the other regular version on DVD."
A1PCEE966CENEL_19830,I gave this movie about three minuets before I got rid of it.  My suggestion to Amazon would be to do the same....
AA51AGYDH8WV3_11160,I really enjoyed watching this movie since I love action flix. The english subtitles throughout the movie were a little hard to keep up with but okay. Overall a good action flick!
A9Q28YTLYREO7_23215,this film is lacking solid writing and experiences many moments of Lapse timing. Also Julia Roberts Dennis Quaid never quite click.it has some moments but nothing but a average film all the way around.
AE9NP2WIYTMI9_7606,JODY FOSTER IS GREAT AS USUAL.  JODYS CHARACTER DESIGNED THE PLANE.  one A FLIGHT HER CHILD GOES MISSING AND NO ONE SEEMS TO HAVE SEEN HER.  jODY HAS TO FIND HER AND DEAL WITH TERRORISTS ON HER OWN.  JM
A2266ZZCZ0CXWC_14322,"Pretty silly premise, a boys HS with 4-deuce mortars for summer training.  Typical idiocy of actors like Penn."
A2LMZ9UB8O5GLS_3200,"It actually has a bit of a story which I thought was nicer, The Ladies in it are great and the acting was good"
A2RSOTIE8SVK0U_1759,A classic for children and grownups to watch together!  Love this version.  Super fast delivery and great packaging.
A1UC06BPQLIKQX_11333,My son and I watched it. We really enjoyed it. It was so insightful and fitted very well with his current history studies.
A85QLQHMFEKFH_16409,A Great Val Lewton film. Boris Karloff at his best. Horror noir is quite a subgenre. The ending is great.
A2PUOSS4HF333Z_2569,Book is better. You just don't get into the head of the characters the same in the movie.
A3UR7B7WTS7LFT_4585,Vincent Price is always amazing !! Classic story with good actors. this is my favorite version of this movie. You will not be disappointed
A3NO2XWN9ZYV09_12577,"It's great fun to see Shirley MacLaine and Michael Caine in their youth, in this light-hearted film. They worked well together When you are in the mood for something retro and not too serious, this might be just the ticket."
A1J78ORBV61YQT_10870,"It's a little constructed to provide emotions and tension, but in the long run, it's really thought-provoking and does draw genuine emotions."
A5IIE7X9IIJVK_23744,This product is described as a multi-disc set. What I received was a scratched up pirated disc of some anime tv show in a At World's End case.
A2RW68U4HGRJK2_12751,"My son read the book and wanted to watch the movie. As he said ""it's different"" but it matches a lot of the book."
A1ZGS2VHZEPPSM_18569,Silly.  Cary Grant was so young;  Irene Dunne was the better actor.  Full of cliches
A26A5IQT7OQ2DK_7879,"A VERY good movie , I loved it ! Its a great Family movie ."
A10UB9ZGDDN2QD_18479,"tape was unwind; jumping skipping throughout, finally calm down in the end.  Good movie, just wish it didn't give me a headache."
A3478QRKQDOPQ2_5323,"i think she tried to convert him and forgot if she won him over you will have to see it to find out, i think was good one to my memory"
A8JOXJ8DSKOQ5_9806,I guess I prefer to watch documentaries when it comes to the history of war.  Hollywood is guilty of glorifying the gruesomeness of war.
A283RV05QVUTVI_2521,"Wonderful sci-fi story that doesn't depend on special effects and gizmos to entertain.
The characters are fantastic, the story is fantastic, and it keeps you guessing all the way through.
Very enjoyable.  Story-telling at its best."
A3MCE3ZLXB6P4P_13051,"I  Like  this  movie,  what  I  didn't  like  was  watching  10  mins  of  previews  before  the  movie  started.  Also about  every  30  mins,  it  turns  into  a  comic  book  version  of  the  movie."
A17SZSI44O7NMV_4724,"It is diverting enough, but I wouldn't watch it a second time. It is one of many films that were designed to show case Stallone in a hero role."
A23V9JXSA4AYGY_19235,It was a made for tv movie that had too many corny cliches in it and did not hold my interest.
AIAL5PZTDQAED_22553,"Interesting movie, I appreciate that some effort was made for authentic artistic expression but not the greatest movie I've ever seen."
AACJUD2Y4DXWV_513,Hey wonderful classic that I just replaced my DVD with a Blu-ray... Should have it in your collection...
A2JD8SHUU5LFV5_10305,Cute movie that will warm your heart.  Nothing serious here but a nice way to relax and feel some love with the family.
AOP3TFQXYJO7T_23887,"Utterly Unnecessary Vulgarity & Hateful movie, I couldn't watch it all there's SO MUCH Better movies than this on Amazon!  As TIME is precious, I'd recommend finding Better ways to use it!"
A33DIONC1TBKRL_1078,"I love this movie. It made me cry, and was very much like Beaches (in some way) If you loved Beaches the movie, you'll love this."
A353YDEEILYS6R_18465,"Was a bit boring. Harrison Ford is lot like Charlton Heston. If he is not a heroic figure, he sucks."
AYLX5AA3A0BM_21940,"Stupid, lazy comments.  I find it hard to believe even a low intelligence child would find it entertaining."
A3JW5HBDT9Z786_9187,"Don't waste your money.  Boring right from the start and continued.  No plot, no suspense, a B movie at best."
A2CDG04L5DV1J7_2436,"It was interesting and quirky, but the best thing about the movie was watching a young beautiful Uma Thurman."
A1T1PKVGMBRPWI_1525,Why was Brad Davis not nominated for an Oscar for this?? He's terrific in the role. As are John Hurt and Randy Quaid.
A1H87IM9FH0S8W_8883,"I love Eastwood, but this was a big disappointment.  It lacked excitement  and a captivating plot."
A27NTHPTRXB766_15581,Would have been good if characters were not from stone age.  Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock knew all these characters.  Did not even know anything was black and white now.
A2ERCQZNOZSAXI_18572,plot goes nowhere  everything makes 0 sense  chickens attacking was probably my favorite part  really bad
A1146A7F9D9CZ9_6927,"Very funny, uncommon and weird horror movie.

The ""calling cards"" joke is one of my favorites!

Kind regards,

darkmark"
A2F9A5L4WGT0EL_7528,"Jodie Foster easily carries a film. This one could have used some shortening, yet it was still a solid, gripping film. My family remained glued."
A27HXKABDH4WJ_1394,"this is one of my sons favorite Halloween movies. I personally don't consider it one of my favorites, but, I will watch it because of roddy."
A19ND6XFXIUVWZ_17306,"Great movie, but the playback was terrible.  I literally was only able to watch it in 5 minute increments.  It just kept freezing and buffering.  So frustrating!!!"
AAZJX2GXEIT50_3124,"Most enjoyable.  I didn't know the full story of the Spitfires birth, so this was very interesting."
AVR64LFV50CEM_18541,Was going to get this Lone Ranger DVD for my son. He loves western movies. I didn't buy this one because it said run time is one minute.
A3VBJ9BETTN07V_10855,"Douglas King, Boris Karloff never played a werewolf! Dig the movie and Jack big time!"
A2VR60EKCYOZD0_14218,Not a great movie but also not bad. One of those where you watch when you want to just veg out and not think too much. Not bad for the low cost.
A19BHC8U77N5O2_16379,Maggie Smith is always good but this was just not her forte. But she was younger then and got so much better as she aged and was able to be more choosy about her roles.
A3NPGS3PCHPG7S_2709,I love the story of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and came across this title online.  I thought it was cute.  The illustrations were really neat.
A176XSPJ2Y3T27_5615,I love this movie!  The anniversary addition is great because of the trivia parts that are included and the interviews with the actors so many years after this movie came out.
A2OL2X9S0UL0XY_309,"i love this movie, my second fav old video.

fast car chases, cool car gadgets, and a good sense

of humor. tops james bond any day...."
A3205HUZYD0MNP_20864,I understand why this isn't one of the more well known Coen Bros films. It's okay but it's super kitschy
A1P8U9DXXW614T_22764,"Paula does, that's who!  This is too fast paced.  Not very easy to get the moves.  Maybe if you are a trained dancer."
AP9WKJ5YFQWWB_15597,"COOPER AT HIS UNDER RATED BEST ENTERTAINING FAIR RECOMMENDED BEAU GESTE FOR EVERYONE. ENJOY, ESPECIALLY THE CONCLUSION"
AQKEGKH6UJ1U2_18110,"This movie has a great story.  The incest situation is handled well.  It's not too blatant but obviously there.  However, it's all ruined by a really lousy ending, truly unbelievable.  How are dead people suddenly resurrected?  No explanation.  Weird!"
A3F28RI5XMM13W_21173,"This is a great film with terrific acting and beautiful cinematography. Prepare to block out your entire evening though, because it is excruciatingly long."
A2ZSU7FJ0TFVDM_12427,Brings me right back to rainy Sunday afternoon movies. R&H hits the right tone for me.
A2OP2G62XZBXBX_13280,Watched this one many years ago and can remember laughing. Seemed kind of silly this time around.
A2IO5YOBC39CZ5_3063,"Fallen is a great psycho-thriller, with good acting and a very strong narrative.  No gore, little violence, incredible intensity.
If you loved the intrigue and surprise of The Sixth Sense, you'll enjoy this movie."
A32DTCFBBB9WIV_1038,"Well, all you'll get watching this freak movie is a little bit of gore ( bad special effects, by the way .. )and some young actors who seem to be wearing skirts yet ... Sad. Skip it."
A3MMFMSH76ZA96_2641,Two great stars make this an excellent movie. I really enjoyed how Paul Newman turns the situation around at the end.
A363N932XRAT4A_9829,"Classic John wayne... action, yet has a plot, interesting has some history, even though it is a movie, good solid actors and fun to watch the Duke."
A2KURLAGE596UA_7400,"What else can you say. Though I don't care too much for Jane Fonda, this movie has always been one of my favorites. I've seen it numerous times."
A3L21A8CJ4CUTC_7969,I LOVE THIS MOVIE BECAUSE IT IS A FUN AND FUNNY RENDITION OF THE OLD FAIRY TALE.  LOTS OF FUNNY SPOOFS ON THE CLASSIC FAIRY TALE.
A11BSCGB3XPB6_18513,My God that dreadful Irish accent. What was Welles thinking? Bejazus and begorrah I've a fine stick here to beat the lousy acting with. 10 minutes of leprechaun level brogue and I was out.
A2MPODWDSZB12P_15040,Excellent spy thriller.  Robert Redford and Faye Dunaway are very good and Max Von Sydow is excellent as the hitman.
AVIF6YESQ5KIM_13304,It is a very funny movie  a bit corny and dated but still brings many laughs.  It helps if you are old enough to get all the eighty's jokes.
A3PT1WF4F1TV3D_12224,GREAT SCI FI FILM FROM THE 50S BUT THE PRINT IS BAD ALOT OF DIRT IN THE VIDEO
A2DGBT7SA6LJWM_21494,"I watched it to see how it related to Shakespeare's Henry IV, but otherwise I would not have picked a movie like this.  Definitely NOT something to show students!"
A392S5MZYVKE0Q_13005,"My copy came with a warped cover art insert, possibly from moisture in transit. Movie looked great though."
A3VHUGZ7WUAZ9N_8759,A fun book to get away and fantasize for little girls.  All little girls should have their idea of a Daddy.
A1PXKDVQ054ZLE_11614,"Never finished this stupid ""B"" movie. It should've destroyed. 10 minutes in I clicked quit!"
AWAW6I6KRPS1L_8271,Another gift that we bought and gave it to someone and they loved it! Disney is great at making movies!
A3JOLTSV6DJWW7_17250,"I usually like Mel Brooks movies, This one Fell flat, It had one, maybe two scenes that were brought out a laugh."
A2MACOLU2QFDBA_20308,"Given the capability of Gleason and Carney, this is a lightweight production. It was disappointing, to say the least. I would not recommend it."
AWH2XX8OK4PCS_6289,Wonderfully creative screenplay with clever characters. Fun script. My go-to chick flick! Love it and watch it over and over.
A2QGLZST7ZYEOJ_21198,"Husband wanted to watch a western and he picked this one.  Nobody plays Doc Holiday like Val Kilmer!  ""I'm your huckleberry."""
A1MIIV8W9X09BK_4879,Love this movie been trying to it on DVD for a while and thanks to Amazon I found it.
A1D4MDXU1J5XXP_17183,Nicely done family movie. Acting was okay but for some of the actors it was probably their first or earlier movies in their careers.
A13Q6QVKC12C3M_3156,This is one of my favorite old movies.  I watch it several times a year.  Just got to love Cary Grant.
AL1ITWCH7W86I_3506,"I love this movie.  It's always a good one.  Every time I watch it I'm like, I need to watch this more often."
A11D7V92J5OVCU_5874,One of the best drug movies ever. Also one of the best movies about a writer. As a drug addict writer this is a double dose of awesome.
A1HJCD42IQQTZA_14109,"A classic from another age, but to me it was a lot of talent wasted on a tired old story. I think I  slept through a lot of it. Sad to say. The scenery, exterior shots were inspired."

A2VFNMQVAEH2T5_561,"sorry ,my internet speed isn't that good, couldn't watch the but 10 minutes of the movie."
A3H09VQI43K2PJ_9394,The film is  well edited and included all of the impact of the original. It was a treat to see it again.
A4JLLU4RMM673_17555,"transfer to Blu-ray could have been better, I cant understand why they do such a half hearted transfer to Blu-ray sometimes"
A3B74429DFMXMC_9002,"Great Little 4-Disc set if you don't want or need the Blu-ray version. Good packaging and disc artwork. Wish it had the ""Workprint"" version that is in the Blu-ray collector set."
A14Q3JI6L5RF7L_17347,"If you don't vomit after seeing this piece of garbage you really must be sick. It is absolute filth, plain and simple. No wonder Jennifer Jason Leigh's ""career"" went straight to the toilet."
A7ZHT2BN4BTOH_548,"Seen it a number of times, always enjoy watching it again and again but with a few years in between."
A2GL3WLEN1USDG_388,I love the show and have the whole series. It and myself are oldies but goodies. Very Camp and for its day original. One of the first British made shows to be a hit in a the USA.
A1SQS3N0RV3V6L_13478,"Just plain silly and corny.  It's a mindless movie with a ""happy ending"".  Even in the day I have a hard time believing it was much entertainment.  I had it on while doing other things and didn't miss anything."
A16YCLRKOU0EV3_21803,I'd probably give it 5 stars if Jar Jar Binks wasn't around so much. But it's still an integral part of the Star Wars saga.
A3TZADG4TN659V_17439,A very bad and lame sci-fi movie stars Mark Hamill. Of coarse it has great special effects and the plot is great!
AHYN0IRP5MB57_216,We enjoyed watching even though we ordered late.  Will enjoy for years to come.  Great xmas story.  You/your kids will love it.
A1YOVA6CC1KQ3O_515,"My husband & I both like this movie, so I bought this to replace our VHS format."
A1YMUJ9DW4Z2XC_15986,"I adore Jeff Bridges, but had to stop watching the movie because it was a bit boring."
A3OIJJYC52XBTH_22715,Powers Booth just loaned his name for this one - strictly cameo.  The premise is okay.  The monster's appearance was pretty bad.  I thought I was watching the return of the fly.
A2X3MC25JYWPW6_20202,Interesting story but we're are the home movies and is this really the way rock or Roy felt about his career  I asappointed the way this star was made to look so shallow every line he said code about homosexuality
ATJF4U8BQZMHG_20897,"Same DVD that was released  in early 2000?  It's good but same as old one different CV over no complete season which was just one ,it is a little misleading."
AJNEGTHRLZ24I_22367,The acting was fair to ok but was to slow in the beginning for me.
A168W1XDQRE2IQ_1980,Great Classic Movie!! My niece is actually the one who watched it but this was one of my fav's as a child!!

in wide screen , the way it was filmed."
A2RH40UADT1MVL_7167,I had seen this previously and I had a mentally note to rewatch it some time. I enjoyed the acting and reunited some memories of the stars of the picture.
A3F8ZSPYLAB794_299,"This one is great!, if you haven't seen it, it is totally worth purchasing, My kids were cracking up when they were watching it!"
A3VEAJT1SKBSKE_4948,"Hilarious, doesn't matter if you're a stoner or not, this movie will have you laughing like crazy."
A1WKTDEV6RF6S1_2227,"Yes, this is arguably the best Charles Bronson film. This movie has great fight scenes considering the fact that it was created over 30 years ago and Colburn is great."
A12KRJSDXG0YC2_7583,"I found this slow paced and not realistic.  Love Jodie Foster, so it's worth watching.
I do recommend widescreen for viewing."
AJ5O66D1AEKNZ_20666,"The story is probably fine....but, it is from an old VHS tape, apparently, and the sound, to me, and old guy, is fuzzy!  I use captioning on everything....and I wasn't able to watch this."
A760GDW52QNDT_4505,This is a classic for us. Movie has all the right elements and the actors have always been a favorite of ours.
A3E6T8LK695XUQ_13513,"I really like Bogart but this one was not good, it had an unusual presentation of characters"
A2RGQPYQ9WFS2W_209,One of my favorite Christmas classics.  I love the scene where the future Mrs. Claus sings.  I will be watching several times this holiday season.  My nieces and nephews love it too.

A39D1HG90KX6E7_2435,A totally excellent movie with an imaginative script and great acting. As usual the streaming quality was outstanding.
ALZ1ZAUF02QU6_1108,It was very funny! So many subtle and not so subtle references to so many movies.
A29E6HV2DT7RCI_17168,"A bit campy. Seems like a made for TV special of 1975. But sweet, killed some time on a rainy day."
A1JBMCVO7RSXIL_1924,I really loved this movie and I would recommend it to anyone. It came before the date required and in the quality stated.
A1KD8NJPZ01R37_21030,"Sorry, never watched the movie. If it has ANYTHING to do wit that book, it's an abomination. Psy-warfare that takes fact and mixes with fiction so the 'tattler' (conspiracy nut) sounds like a nut."
A2U8LVO2VCFX1J_17764,I DID NOT LIKE IT. IT HAD NUDITY AND IS NOT FOR A FAMILY TO WATCH. I DID NOT LIKE IT.
A2WZA4NSQBCPDO_6030,"Del Toro and Depp are a match made in Heaven in this flick. Its just as funny now as it was the first time I watched it. If you haven't seen it, then what are you waiting for??"
A6DZTTNLGSDR8_16001,"Did William Holden ever make a bad film?  I think not.  His rescue of this winsome, eccentric Chinese woman is funny, sad and sweet."
A3BFJFJRXMWXAX_17909,Little to no extras.  This great film deserves better treatment than this.  We can always hope.
A1W8KACWQ7BCRK_4586,"I really liked it, this is the only movie I have of Vincent Price singing and playing the piano. Interesting.  He also seemed to know his history too"
A31EZRZ6NUSMSR_5546,This movie keeps getting better. I used to find it annoying and immature but its actually brutally honest. Not a very realistic scenario but i now see it as a great take on a possible situation given the different personalities.
A1PWFNIDTZCY08_11540,"Sometimes funny. Ironic, and we'll acted. Plot becomes a bit out of control towards the end."
A2EBIAO3YJGMBA_5512,This is a great remake of Village of the Damned. It is eerie and I never get tired of watching this movie. I actually like it better than the original.
A22C7IXLYIH17W_15100,Love this old film. If your a fan of old Black and white film and the sci-fi stories of radiation mutating things then you will enjoy this one.
AKFM9WXLEU9S4_16075,The movie is one of my favorites but the video on this Blu-Ray is the worst I have ever seen on a Blu-Ray.  Be advised...
A2LB8VDT59VTP5_22565,I can not play it on my dvd player due to the fact that it was zoned to a different area than the US.
A1ZHCUGDEOXA98_16011,Glenda Jackson is one of my favorites.  I think no actress could have played this better.
AL5C1AUKDQ8TD_8432,A little unbelievable and extremely predictable. You basically hate Matt Damon's character the whole movie but what gives? Good movie though.
A3IE34MBDFKJ53_11061,"Love the series, but after only 1 or 2 uses, disks in perfect condition, like perfect mirrors, sometimes won't play, or they freeze in the middle of watching"
A2CZSPX6EYAN3T_18043,"80's movies are still cool to me! My kids (13 and 10) kind of got a little bored in the middle. But, still a good movie with a good message."
A3JH9D4VAIOF8H_16361,"All I can say is it is a 70s movie...maybe late 60s which all have their own ""soap operish"" quality but the acting is good. Carol Burnett has one very memorable moment of dramatic acting...she was good."
A1ZB54SC6PYRWN_8052,Movie is great. The digital copy is junk; only limited to certain platforms. Cannot use with Apple. Very disappointing overall. Great movie though!
AS9GG6P6JKO3Z_18670,"Hilarious film.
Bought as a present for my dad. It's one of his fav movies of all time."
A2UT0LMK1CH1CC_12446,Supplier made very good DVD from probably VHS tape. One of the best I have seen for a movie not longer out there but can be re recorded.
A1UE22BDYWF17P_7537,More suspense than most and a well thought-out plot. Jodie Foster is great in her role as a distraught mother (or is she?).
A2QHJROLDZDL2S_10809,"Would have been nice to know the original wasn't cleaned up. IE some areas I had the urge to get up and clean the TV screen.
Otherwise Great product."
A91LE0MPYE8GJ_6428,"I liked, this but sad, but this was a good movie, well you'll like this. If your a, Carrey fan watch this....."
A309Q7UF99S18Y_4994,A true Classic. I loved this movie when I saw it years back and love it even more now. Whether you've read the book or not it's a truly great classic movie.
A24U0RKHMX1RVO_9672,good series for star trek.  I watched this series religiously and can't recall seeing all these episodes.  Oh well.  I continue on.
A17J1LVPIWZIK1_13683,"I barely remember the movie Flashdance, but I recall that I liked it. In the information provided, it says this is a 57 minute version, but it is the whole film."
A7HD7SGI1R937_18977,"This is a pretty good movie, made great by some awesome stunt-driving and by the fact that Michael Caine is in it. As far as picture/sound quality and special features, well, it's an old DVD: it lacks."
A2EB6JGRPDY4R4_19137,"The scenic was beautiful. This guy is out there in clean clothes, never see him wash his clothes and had new sets of clothing, so it is not for real. Poor movie."
A2XE1LZJ29WSCK_18130,"Though I own this movie, I never watch it.  The first movie is the best movie, this one just can't compare."
APTNKE3AAJK4F_21391,"Total cornball, but good fun. Science in the 30's is a hoot , particularly the cheap variety. How often do you do you get singing cowboys and clunky robots in the same movie."
A7U81HSVJTF7K_531,"Oh, to have such a man as our commander-in-chief!  But also, to have people who are willing to sacrifice their all to insure the continuity of our nation's constitutional ""mind.""  It was a terrific, barn-burner of an action adventure film!"
A186KHJ2HEMJAU_4781,I have watched this movie a lot of times.  I think it reminds me of my childhood in a small town.  Great movie
A3C86Z091BN3AL_7250,"Decent action movie. ""Camp"" in a good sense. Concept of ""universal soldier"" as developed in the film is both morbid and provocative."
A2B9W1KRWF3NAP_18432,Had some plot and great surging shots.  Not too great.  I gave it away already to a friend that likes it.
A2AYEHC9KUBWWG_1498,"I need to get this on blue ray, because this is still the best in this movie series!!! This one is as close as it will get to the games!!!"
A18U1LZ25ZVWAJ_13563,Fun flick.  Have seen it a number of times but I still find innuendos I missed.  Nice to watch when you need a smile and don't want to think too much.
A2FWXX8SLOY9VJ_10253,"It was pretty clear, obviously not HD clear but better than some of the other older films"
AJHT4T0TINHCQ_12147,I took a chance on this video for my granddaughters and I must say it did not hold their interest. The story is kind of goofy. There are many other Easter videos that are much better.
A2ZFLYB780V69W_6656,This is a must have film for Kevin Spaceys fans. Well done with all actors in good rolls.
ALZ2TZ88UAIE3_10493,"""Call me sometime when you got no class."" This is classic Rodney, one of his better movies in my book."
A20EP18MTFZ9F0_22800,"Why they would include the original mono soundtrack as an optional audio track doesn't make sense. Another wasted opportunity, and waste of money."
A8X8D4BUY5DFU_3231,"Another really good satire/spoof of horror movies, with deadpan great Leslie Nielsen in another starring? role."
A2UKCISVFSV1YV_15270,Terrible story line.  When I order I thought that I was ordering Up Town Saturday night.  At least that was what it was labeled as.  To my surprise and it was this movie.
A3JTGRI3VNLCKH_16294,I bet he wishes he never took this job. plus Kevin hardly make an appearance (to his credit)
AETL2F84RTNM7_16803,"Pretty good movie, not great but better than most movies. Its worth your time. I've seen it a couple of times."
A2NR38N3QB3JJ2_11784,"Having lived through the 60's, my memories of that time period on up, is very different than portrayed in this film.  MLK knew that power in the USA is through peacefully getting, keeping, and exercising our voting rights."
A2EKSOLTKBGWTK_21381,"Careful streamers, the ""R"" rated version of Caligula is not what you are looking for, if you are looking. You probably want the unrated cut though you will wish you could unsee it after you watch it."
A2P3FTETTI44PU_22754,Not a very sharp picture.  Save a few bucks and buy the standard DVD or wait until Criterion releases a Blu-ray version.
A27QYNFPGFZDT8_11772,"A very good docu-story.  I have read many books about WWII but very little is said about the glider pilots.  If you are a WWII history buff, a video well worth watching."
A2XYUG83CCZ4N6_17486,"There are a couple of songs that are catchy sung by Stubby Kaye.  The story is exaggerated sexist, but funny."
A3JVYK8FZTYRZQ_15278,"A fun way to spend a rainy afternoon. Peter Cushing just gets better as I get older.  In my opinion, the material is very adult."
A10GP4WUDKHJNE_12473,It had some good pacing and surprises but some parts were a little stretch to the imagination
A296A1BJ0W7AM2_9275,An old movie that I enjoyed seeing again. How can you go wrong with two funny guys and a beautiful woman.
A1X054KUYG5V_10538,"The Bottom Line:

A rare Holocaust film without an overarching message, Europa Europa is simply the story of a Jewish boy attempting to survive any way he can; consistently engaging and well-acted, it's an interesting and well-made film."
A1J03J0HZ7KU5T_18090,Technicolor and CinemaScope could not save this dreary 1954 adaptation of Hal Foster's beautifully drawn comic strip. Robert Wagner gets stuck with the black wig and director Henry Hathaway wishes he went that away. Even children will be bored.
A267IXCC7UK1HY_7842,"ludicrous and not funny. . .

The leading characters are very attractive in looks, but the Cinderella story (with comedy scenes like Shaw's Pygmalion) is predictable and totally preposterous without being really entertaining.

Not worth the trouble."
AEABDCPC35CVP_12996,"It's still fun.  The music is dated, but this is Eddie at the peak of his powers....before his ego took over."
AQFS5PUUINYTA_6701,"This wasn't on a par with circa 2000 movies - but a good one, anyway; and probably more family oriented actually.
Creature was well done; and it is a good movie."
A2ZHB4N06H3JU6_19805,for Agatha Christie fans only.  The only good thing about this film is that the acting is adequate.  Although a faithful adaptation of the book it should've been even more so.
A8NQVLIE0QVT4_7949,"Great movie, even better dubb. Blu ray is the only way to go on movies like this one and Mama Mia!"
A1KM9J57TJ65TC_15693,Good crime adventure flick. The message seems to be crime doesn't pay because these guys are so dumb.
A1VDL63FYZ3JII_3844,A good movie with a little bit of everything ranging from action to humor and more
A1J2QFNNQLMALE_6226,I liked it. I'm kind of a G-rated person so that's why I gave it 4 stars not that it was to bad in any manner.
A1QBNXY0NETWKI_23786,suck fvnfvjf fnf dfmnf vmnf vnmf fvmf fmf fvmf fmffmf fmf vfmffn fdf df ndfmf fvmnf vmf fvmf vmvf vmf vmf
ADTJ2CZSSN7V4_22806,"It's a Christmas classic, viewable for both young & old. The Laurel & Hardy comedy style still holds it's own."
AL0YWOV75HZKL_9934,Another disaster movie about an asteroid headed for Earth. Well done and a plausible scenario.
A2M75Q5OAOHAWR_10910,"Picture quality was very good, nice contrast without noticeable artifacts. Sound was very good considering it was originally mono (Western Electric)."
A12HFBMIC0J8D6_6844,"Strange movie with no real reason to his insanity.  No closure either...just a random spattering of homicide, psychosis, and nonsense."
A2TCAP5M1GK5CN_15708,Classic Trek done up all pretty and telling the stories Roddenberry strove to tell! Can't wait to crack this set open!
AXPH696ZBBOOZ_7111,"This film sells in 99 cent stores and deserves better, it IS a legend long overlooked, check it out and you will be shocked at how many legends did eye popping work in it."
A11SGM6Z9083AD_18312,"I watch the other day this movie ,was not that much action but was worth watching, the actor was playing good roll in the movie, just ok."
ASDXJTEM64265_22725,"it was so terrible, I skimmed thru it. stupid and made on a 10 dollar budget.  I don't need to say anymore"
AQERG0HGDMYL7_6165,"We saw this movie at the theater and wanted to see it again, it's that good."
A10VOEBL5S337W_2384,"I don't need to say anything, it's already been said. I've watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail six times and each time fell off my chair laughing at least twice. Everyone should watch this movie!"
A32ZOSZVX052IJ_1295,This freakin movie is one of the best movies out there period! I can't get enough of this kick ass movie! Everybody should go out and buy it!
A2TZ3QWBEZLOSS_19756,As cheesy as you would expect it to be.  Worth a watch for nostalgic reasons.
A1CWC70ZUIJNOU_19823,This is one of my favorite movies. But the DVD sound quality is terrible. You really have to crank the volume up to hear anything. And then you hear lots of static and distortion.
A3VB55B11HVOCZ_12359,Its a cheesy monster movie so if you like that this is what you want.
A36KJYDBSISU8W_8796,"The world has been destroyed, Max has lost everything, but he won't stop doing things the ""right way"" even if he has gotten a lot harder from what he's been through. Classic post apoc Sci-Fi that doesn't get old."
A2YSGAY63J4A7W_1688,"Sinatra at the height of his singing and stage presence.  Rita Hayworth tough, tender, alluring. Kim Novak perfect for the part she played."
A2UYX90M3Z9Y5Q_6241,"A simple but moving love story, a classic performance by Julia. One of my all-time favorites."
A38Q66OZFRUPSR_17551,"I was annoyed by the lack consistency in the main character's accent. It was terrible. Why have someone who cannot keep a consistent accent, have an accent in your movie?"
A1LIHIG05ZT5K3_3029,"This movie contained way too much foul language for me and my wife. We're not prudes, but it seemed like every conversation was loaded."
A1M7CK5DI1T89D_12159,"This is ""the classic"" zombie movie. Romero's take on a zombie flick is quite impressive. Not as violent or intense as some modern movies, but it still holds up and is definitely worth a watch."
A34QFZDB8LOT4J_14738,the story of the eternal friend who is in love with her best friend and in the end gets the girl
A2QI93E2DU7I57_2590,I enjoys the kinder and more gentle subject of manners and expectations of a more civil society and the rules hat bind them.
A296SUXBMGWDQP_10822,"Lucas...bring back the originals on DVD! Not this new crap that was retuned to match your horrible prequels.

Disgusting."
A4449WGDKEIC1_6662,"If you love classic sci-fi horror from the 50's you will love this.
From the opening credits to the closing credits, you will be absolutely absorbed. The acting the creepy music, everything is in sync.
A-Must-Have for your sci-fi collection."
A10DZEGCHHNJTS_8355,Way ahead of it's time.  The HD visuals are spectacular.  Great acting and great writing in this classic movie.  Amazing.
A2RPQFS8KA1B6X_23211,"What a disappointment. Love Firth, but not in this silly movie. And it went on and on and on."
A2NKO8BSARTXMM_12727,"Its a movie showing the over-reach of governments, and a group of people who devise a means to retain information from books, which are outlawed."
A2LVHY1FGKAUCT_4393,Don't you just love Burl Ives????!!!!  And Barbara Eden isn't the Genie!  I love Tony Randall as well.  Great cast and the movie is fun.  I am very happy with it.
A7CG8DA3SR97Z_17366,"This is another rehash of the 2011 release.  So you get the horrible restoration with bad colors, crushed blacks and stupid changes.  Do not buy this release.  Tell Lucasfilm we want the original versions, not the Special Editions."
A3CYRFIHPO8J5C_18261,I only thought this was so so. I wouldn't recommend it or even watch it again. I've seen better.
A2JDWBJ5GYRU65_13648,"An old favorite.  True love story between two people from very different upbringings and wealth.  Meet while at college.
Great casting, lovely music."
A23IKH0J2U35XJ_13522,This movie did not depict the real Jean Harlow.  It was not what I expected and the end was not accurate.  I don't think I would recommend this movie.
A2YGHIVY5CZ0N1_18428,This movie shows how one crime leads to other crimes and sometimes there is not any return to a  straight future.
A2FVQSTJWUBMKZ_1888,"Great film. The one that started it all for so many of these actors and solidified Robert Redford as a great director. Who knew Joseph Gordon-Levitt would become an actor, producer, and director as well. Amazing."
A5T4AAINRF2QZ_15172,This movie was long and kind of bland unless you are very interested in the political process.
A30RCOWI31IC5K_4730,"loved this movie. this is the first one, then Richard Gere and Bruce Willis did theirs. the original is almost always better and this movie proves it."
A23O4VANP2FSZ5_9854,"Edge of your seat action! I've seen this a few times, and enjoy it every time."
A3RTTZPK3OMTO3_7384,It is an old movie but a great one.  Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda are fantastic actors.  I saw this movie when it came out but it is a timeless movie.  Very touching story.
A1C078JJGLRS8F_7896,LOVE this movie.  It's a cute addition to any Disney movie lover's collection.  The music is very entertaining.  Amy Adams is such a funny princess and the ending is absolutely perfect!
A2O894L7GCD6DJ_15516,"Disney has so many great movies and Alice in Wonderland is good, but there are others that are better. Although there are some very classic characters an lines in this movie. A must see once."
A25SBUFGQY5593_17626,"This disk was formatted for foreign players and wouldn't play on any of my players. The purveyor finally responded to my e-mails and refunded my money. I would love to have seen it, since I'm a lover of old movies."
A2J64UBTHP31TE_6025,"You would have had to REALLY enjoyed your teenage years in the 90's, if you know what I mean, to really appreciate this movie. EXTREMELY FUNNY"
A3K1CD85TWVNKO_12335,"I kept waiting for the wow factor.  Truthfully, I watched this almost a week ago and can hardly remember it.  That is how good it is."
A3OMR4PFH033WE_9826,"I'm giving this movie one star only because Harrison Ford. Everything else about this movie is horrible--the stereotypes, the xenophobia, the outright racism, the heroine you wish someone would just shoot already.... Do I really need to go on?"
A4X89NM6EOQ9_4889,"A great, and deeply satisfying classic.
Despite the current uproar about Harper Lee's revised view of Atticus."
A1WTL5M5PD6ZBV_13377,This movie was surprisingly good. The murders are pretty original. Although some resembled murders in the original film. Very good though. I like the fact that it still centers around a camp. Worth watching!
ARBZSHGRSA73K_13642,"A great movie, this the film that started the off beat movie craze, lots of movies followed in its foot steps but Airplane was the creative original! A must see for any off beat comedy lover."
A2ETCT82L8WO0X_10444,Ronin is a disjointed and ridiculous chase movie in search of a plot.  Utter nonsense.
A8NHN9UPML858_17185,I liked this when I was a kid... but I saw it so many damn times! I'm sick of it now... but go ahead and try it!
AXT9ZOAOK4X9O_12489,"i always loved that movie, I had it as a vhs, so it was imperative for me to have it as a dvd. It's a light action comedy movie with Burt reynolds"
A1PZ2SGKQ4V0T9_23464,"came in early. is the right film, not in bad condition could have gotten it new for a few more pennies, a quarter and maybe a nickel. still love the film"
AXQLPJ00PEFTX_11285,No Matter what people may say bad about this movie I still like it ((it could )) have been Better yes but It's what I like that matters Right.
AUFE9JZAY12O1_1536,One of my favorites. Always wanted to run it through computer and edit it about for viewing with small grandkids but never got around to it and tape player no longer works well so stuck.
A1OC3ZLKKLZ42O_16240,Story that is really basic and down to earth but done exquisitely by James Caan and Marsha Mason.  Get it!
A22NKPV5HCV4LJ_18214,"It was funny in places, but after it was over, didn't have a good feeling. Overall I didn't like it."
A21P8BFX88A9PR_13998,This is a good moral movie that the whole family can watch together. I would recommend this movie to you as well.
AQCZXINY4WERY_20512,This has got to be the most silly Sci-Fi I have seen in a long time.
A2F6S5C738ZANF_5738,love the scenario of this whole movie. and soundtrack is amazing too. cant go wrong with this classic. 80s well done
A37EWN5SS67OOA_19387,"The plot was silly, the acting was bad, the script was boringly written. I didn't like this movie at all."
A2H6SHG6OO9F9K_18242,The film features likable actors but the humor centers around crude sexual innuendos. It seemed that the film was trying to break the traditional romantic comedy mold by being edgy and crass.
A2O88HFN90MISY_23671,Would not play on any of my DVD and/or Blue Ray systems!  I was thoroughly disappointed because this movie is a classic!
AIN8LLM3KBQMF_9016,The most overrated Sci-Fi film ever! Not as bad as 2001- A Space Odyssey but still pretty bad!
A1J1M1M9NCJ7BI_9846,Good WW2 move one of the best.  Good to see John Wayne even if it's an older movie to bad there is not more like it.
A8E05J4OCUF9S_13551,Very funny movie. A different roll for Humphrey Bogart. The HD color version was beautiful. About three escaped convicts from Devils Island who help a shop keeper with his overbearing boss Basil Rathbone.
A180L437DJ52VC_7243,"Excellent acting performance by Downey Jr., most likely the best of his career. His portrayal of Chaplain was spot on.  The plot/biographical essay is very interesting and moves along quickly.  A twice a year view."
A13M3WDOEC5D69_17080,Wasn't bad for what I have never heard of or seen before. My hubby made me watch it.
A31T3VAZKGFMEK_22392,My grandchildren and I have really enjoyed watching this dvd since receiving it a few weeks ago.  I would buy it again.
A3GHXBXZNZDA9O_9888,I am a John Wayne fan and lately there has not been much to watch on TV. It has been years since I saw this movie and it is fun finding all the many famous actors in it as well.
AM1ABL1W3NX7Y_7762,"I bought this because I have watched it several times on T.V. This way, there are no commercials to watch! It's a movie I will continue to watch again and again. I love this movie!"
A1TE4IF5XHQ9JD_10507,"I would never put this film among my favorite films, but it is genuinely funny.  It will not leave you disappointed."
A4PPZNQF1X2IY_19592,"The following reviews are for the original, not the 2009 remake.  The new movie is a snoozer, so beware."
A24GD68SY12QGZ_18922,"Enjoyable spoof, but if you're looking for the real thing, go with the Daniel Craig effort of 2002."
A3TX8CXYZIPT71_10449,Good action movie.  I like Robert De Niro in almost all his movies.  I liked it but it is definitely not a five start.
A22Q1MA9I8U6OE_18877,Disc would not play properly. Had to return it. Disappointed because my husband really likes these kind of movies.
A3RNC9BGR4J1ZF_7673,I LIKE THIS MOVIE. THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE. THIS IS A GREAT FAMILY MOVIE; I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO ANYONE WHO ENJOYS WALT DISNEY MOVIES!!!!!
A2S381PVSUWBEY_9478,"My husband didn't like Sea Wolves because it was boring and he tells me to say the ending of the movie but I will keep it to my self.
Either way of all his war movies he liked this least."
A2EUL8Q4SAUV6I_16511,Isabella is glamorous and mysterious in this movie.  Have to wait to the end of the movie to see the outcome!
AWQ3YY5W86K4Q_4591,"Awful, it lacked on plot / comedy, bland and boring ! not Woody Harrleson's or Keifer Sutherland's best movie !"
A365VIN0ESABZ8_1849,The film was intriguing.  Faye Dunaway is a good actor.  Tommy Lee Jones never disappoints.  See more at dovegroup at weebly dot com.
A1562DDZ79BUOD_22585,"While mildly entertaining, the is a very strange movie.  The novelty of the presentation wore thin after the first 45 minutes and it verged on silliness.  Further, I didn't understand the significance of the beginning and ending scenes."
A1I19EHP4W4U50_17686,I finally watched it cause people raved. We thought it sucked in nearly every way.
A35TT1SGEOYHPS_7678,"Dorothy McGuire was the quintessential canine/boy mother of their time.  Both of these movies are tear jerkers, yet she helps the boy to understand, bear and deal with death."
A2ACVMYXHAMDNW_14383,"was like a slap-stick comedy, he had an ego as big as the war itself! Didn't like the film that much."
A3BKR3RCAZ7IOX_13181,Loved this movie when it first came out. But it looks a little dated by today's standard. Still. All in all... this was the Star Trek movie that fans wanted to see in the 1980s.
A7CPA6L23CSB4_1449,that I bought and watched too long ago to remember anything specific to write about. I do not have the time to watch it again just to write a review...
A2XSSBQPK11HF7_8019,The fact that Jim Henson died at 59 and Donald Trump is President in his seventies.... is why I'm an atheist.
A1P6YBYL8ECUUA_1595,"Best movie ever! resident evil is great, this movie really bring it all alive. From the Setting to the DEAD! it was awesome, you must see this!"
A26YCV25Q02M43_19588,I had been looking for this movie for years due to my feelings for the title song.  Much better than the later release.
AGDVHB8T4SVJZ_14628,"This movie remind me the Six Days Seven Nights in the 80.  It will give you good laugh and good ending,"
A461VTLW9G9YB_1100,"Very good movie. Kid is stolen, Mom goes crazy, family becomes a mess. Kid is found but its all unpredictable. Rent it and see how the story unfolds."
A1GRHM90J8GT0L_19462,"This movie was difficult to watch.  I did not make it through, it was too sad.  Parents who would rather have their child suffer than to let him go should not be lauded."
A125WQNKXGN51G_3306,"Really cute, funny show, I love this series especially Scooby recommended for kids and adults and fans of the series"
A1JO9ASNRPW2IG_2204,A very well done underrated fairly accurate period piece. This movie gives gives the viewer a glimpse of life during the depression.
A3TKLSDNUYGKFL_6752,IT WAS A FUNNY MOVIE AND GOOD PERFORMANCES BY BOTH ACTORS.  I WULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO OTHERS.  GOODN FLICK
A3VUF7MR1JR5J4_7886,I never really looked at this movie until I got it on DVD for my girlfriend.  Nice story and good acting.  The added background info about the production of the movie is cool.
AJZNROJ3BYNT4_512,Great movie. You will cheer for America by the end. Colin Kaepernick has probably never seen it.
AQMGZH232OM9I_20149,"The Roswell incident in 1947, I believe, was the inspiration for dozens of sci-fi flicks in the 1950's.  If you like eerie, creepy creatures from other worlds, then know that It Came From Outer Space!"
A3PMZD8OJPI8M_23644,I see movie he steal little people for greedy gold and he use him as April fool it I laugh too hard my stomach it
AGJRH529ZYA8Z_1055,"Again, another great Julia Roberts movie. This movie really pulls at your heart strings no doubt! I'm really glad I bought it!"
AVY0FJZ4VFZ3T_3697,Highlander is still one of my Favorites & was a great way to begin the legend of The Immortals... Great Soundtrack & Ideas!
A25C8U4KMGWQ0V_6176,lol this not a usa film if i new i would not of got it
A2GO7AK5SR9VJH_9032,"This was a pretty interesting movie. Some parts where a little too ""Hollywood"", but the story-line flowed very well."
A2K0ZFTEY4NXM2_5083,"I like this movie.  My next movie to order is The Yearling with Gregory Peck.  He also had a short part in the remake of Cape Fear, which he also starred in.  All his movies are good."
ABMT044NB75BX_11342,This was a very good movie. The cast did a very good job along with the writers and filming. I would recommend this to others as a great good movie to watch.
A3B4JP8DDTLQWU_15093,Far better than I would expect a science fiction movie from the 50s.  It would have been much better with modern technology or would it?  It seemed fine with its goofy creatures.
A2JONP1A27UTI8_8110,got to love Disney. cannot go wrong when it comes to Disney movies they are the best.  was added to the dvd collection that we have
A3IQGFCZGQV2JG_7525,Not as good as the first one (not that i enjoyed it very much either). Kids were somewhat entertained by it.
A3THT5D3S4IYE9_12428,nothing positive to say about this seller or product...except buyer beware. May not as I did receive what you paid for.
A4GSQJBIIWK5I_17430,this is the worst zombie movie that i have ever seen. don't bother watching it. waste of time and money
AUMDVFNWLX9PB_13897,Basic story line is exciting but as always too much unnecessary swearing. The plot does move right along.
A2CB67NJBN9C5E_17840,We're big Thin Man fans.  The fact is - this one is the weakest entry in the series.
A3LQ91UFD0Z59P_15171,Pretty good interpretation of one of the US Army's greatest comebacks on the Krauts in WW2!
A9Q28YTLYREO7_9776,this is a very boring film and very predictable. This film was done a year before this one came out. This film is The White Waiting To Exhale. Pure formula. You'd swear Puff Daddy was the director?
AL62RH38AMAFO_744,A golden oldie with a stellar cast.  It still elicits chuckles after all these years.
AG8D804FUG5Y4_113,My wife told me of this movie in which Henry Winkler stars & shows he can act in this different version of a Christmas Carol.
AKOJXI7735NT0_7297,"This movie was one of the last Latex FX movies and it looks good in BD, sounds good as well.  Story could have been better but it is an Action/Adventure film so that is OK."
A3NUAU3L04S1X9_4172,"Hey, this am not no Private Ryan but it not a bad WWII era war movie"
A1MK02HC440QT8_17329,a stunning waste of a good movie. cut by some 2 hours or more this is just a pure waste of time and disc when the complete miniseries is out there to be had . this is just junk!!!!!
A3ONQ5TKD3SFOM_12879,Nonstop lame jokes and no real plot. I have seen worse though not by much.
ADGRC6O3AGRQL_17604,"This movie lacks all imagination that could have been put into the production. There is just a lot of male nudity and gore, and eerie sexual tension between the boy and his horse."
A3BJG9FJ492KX9_5848,"VERY WELL ACTED IT'S LIKE LOOKING INTO THE WINDOW OF LIFE..WATCHING IT NEARLY FALL APART , WANTING TO GIVE UP THEN FIGHTING FOR LIFE.A BEAUTIFUL WELL ACTED MOVIED"
AH32KWLLS6IFK_3887,Epic Movie use to watch  it a lot on t.v. now i can finally have it as my own.
A11UNJ6AMPS3NT_11395,"This movie follows the classical story, but is extremely dull, to say the least. I do not recommend it to anyone."
A2KPX76CNPFHSR_4357,"At first I thought no good but I stuck with it and
I was surprised, very good did not know of this
Battle and the lose of life."
A1QUF12XRN4JUR_23785,"Acting and story both good.  I am not much of a ""War"" aficionado but I enjoyed this one because it made the point of battle without belaboring the point.  I enjoyed the old clips of bombing raids."
A2WVS6ZYERU4L4_2629,"Brilliant work. The acting is superb, believable. Plot is unpredictable. Story's thoughtful, engaging and the characters are rich and real. This is one of the better films of all time."
AQ6WXOXDZIYCS_12309,"Amateur film making, watch it to see every film student cliche' in a single movie. Actually, I don't recall any B&W scenes, so maybe not every cliche'."
A195DWIE4V1FMJ_12369,"I thought I would like it better now than when it first came out. Today, I resold it. However, good fast delivery and quality product. Thanks!"
A2LB8VDT59VTP5_14697,It is interesting to see what this man did during WWII. He was one that was involved in an attempt to get rid of Hitler.
A3L9E0YI7C5G0W_12533,Great classic disaster movie we have have already watched multiple times. Conversion to Blu-ray is excellent. Movie itself can't help but feel dated.
A2R7DCFT7S5GGY_12270,I'll watch it over and over again! Just love this old Sinatra movie. Sterling Hayden shines as the town sheriff.
ABGP4N5RGOHAT_13774,"I purchased this flick because an article I read. It purported to explain the meaning of ""PARALLAX"" as in using a rifle scope, this it did not."
A2ZD5F9YX2DR24_22473,"This is an ok movie--funny at times.  boring at others.  Not one to play when you are tired.
Characters funny.  Not as exciting as the pro reviewers say."
A2XUNSLMNAZ127_21021,print quality was not good and overall production was marginal at best. Ok to watch once.
A3BQU9CHGZVMY8_4437,"Great story.  Funny, poignant and thought provoking.  Patrick Swayze, Jr. was incredible as always.  The future will always miss his talent."
A1WJNR2ARJTEJ6_5897,"One of the best comedies ever, especially if you've done some this and can relate."
A3FR77VKS4ZHGA_13397,"Not a great movie. Outdated, but fun to watch old computers. If you can't find anything else to watch it is okay."
APHEX2PC3SRR9_9407,"not your typical clint eastwood  but worth watching, saw as a kid and wanted to see again not something you can find anywhere."
A2QPGGXRKT3PCY_1039,"I love this movie.  I think it's beautifully written, produced and directed and highly under-rated.  I never tire of it."
A3JT5O8B42LISD_15468,"Great version of this classic story!! I seem to remember that the  ""I give myself very good advice, but I very seldom follow it"" song was a bit  longer in the original video, however. Great video. Timeless video."
A2PJ3GMLLST4KA_2261,As silly as I remembered.  The one liners are awesome.  I find I have aged since seeing this last.
A1Q4NOA9XJVNC0_1974,Bridges & Williams - great actors and this story can be timely in any decade but it is a bit long and the anguish of both characters suffering thru their arcs is well acted but takes patience. Would recommend.
A36YVUL7GGQVVM_17732,"I only bought this movie because my mom and dad saw this on their first date in 1946.  I thought it was a bit drawn out, but the cast of starts was good.  Wait until the finale at the end!"
AQ2PMHNGIVEV9_2089,It is fun to review these shows that I watched on TV in the past.  Still fun and enjoyable.  Very well written and acted.
A1CST0HUAIRPCT_21783,Something to watch once in a while. The office administrator elf is a wonderful character.
A1R2E2FETD8VYU_13883,Too much foul language. Very clear that Eddie Murphy is not doing his own fighting in this.
A1EFN6V0F4XT3W_21608,Movie is awesome. DVD has scratch so the scene of bloody massacre can't play. Too late to complain.
A2NRHG6WATR39X_2393,"Watching
This movie made me stop and think, in the not to distant future this could happen."
A1VJBUCNMP5CEO_18950,This film I did not particularly care for.  It just seems to me that Roger Moore is tired of making them at this point and he's doing it for the money.
A2BWABMN9IM4SO_7140,"Great story! Not too scary for freaky, but just the right amount mystery and suspense."
A2P64DWIPY4O2_98,This is one of my favorites... I was very happy to see it on this site. Henry Winkler  played this part well.
A2DPWR9GZH5L13_8338,I bought this for myself love this movie. If you are a fan of the classic cartoons you will love this
A3DXYKQQSRYOP1_12974,"Had this movie been made in 2017, then I would definitely give it one star."
A11E9SGWWJS3UU_713,"Classic movie that takes a grainy, hard look at America and the rift between generations. Bigotry, racism, experimental drugs and all under a psychedelic blanket of bizarre camera work, scenic views and confusion about what life is meant to be."
ACO20QL72D1E6_10098,This i s  over-the-top and on the stupid side. The plot and the gaytheme never reach catharisis; it`s only helped by the Italian landscape and the ever impressive Jude Law...
A84K1A2NROW71_15151,"The DVD was of good quality, the packaging is acceptable and is full of memories. This is easy to like, especially if you like old shows. Anyone who likes to remember old shows, buy this one."
A1BWW3VMNDQW0_18310,I didn't like this movie at all. It was a real stinker. I immediately sold this movie on eBay right after I watched it

A2BVV6BUJQW8WI_18478,I can't believe such talented actor's could act so very bad in this movie. Don't waste your time.
AS0FYLRJPVQSC_14968,A wonderful musical satire of an avant-garde adventuress/rebel whose life is changed by arrival of a young charge.  Whose ability to charm takes her through lifestyle changes of new money to the stock market crash to old money.
AK3O2SY6AY679_13612,I thought this would be a comedy classic. It was not. Pretty poor and weak on the humor and story line.
A3FE23YIV31WN6_16818,"Good traditional western, especially if you are a Gregory Peck fan. Very much worthy of your time I think."
A1Y6ZEC4K6UZ9C_4323,Great movies on what soldiers have to deal with in the throws of battle.  The director captures the insanity of war and the impact of dealing with death on a daily basis.
A36VUG52K3V2B2_14858,"A great story about three women in a workplace dominated by a sexist boss.  A great piece to show your kids what ""the old days were like"" or just to relive a world before technology ruled."
A367R3VU46T81P_1823,"great movie everyone enjoyed it especially our 6 year old granddaughter, great music, singing, story and stars.  Loved this older version."
A2WK0N1TJSXQ04_14597,"OK, I know this movie received great critical acclaim and there are a lot of people who really liked it.  Unfortunately, I wasn't one of them.  Proceed at your own risk..."
A1V8QH0B4LVU38_16723,"I somehow missed the fact that it had Weird Al in it. The first scene soon corrected that mistake! It was a nice movie, plenty of Weird Al moments. I'm not sorry I watched it!"
AMKSN0J0ZL2P7_2979,"I knew the movie because I had it on vhs tape. Wanted to replace it with a dvd  Am very pleased with it.
I did not find any dull spots, kept my interest from first scene to last."
A3U8J6HOIYKIFM_16017,"Boring, boring. Wish I had returned it in time. Can not watch. Nothing about it interesting. Will donate to Good Will."
A15JTJXQXO22JJ_22743,"This must be the dumbest movie ever made! , It wasn't even funny either. Now I know why they called it clueless in the first place."
A11RPHRCOKEP2O_6730,"Another Classic Horror Movie that i saw as a youngster at the old Major Theater in Burbank, ca"
A2MYN8EO0TQTZ_3808,"Neil who???? Ha ha ha! yes, yes, a hit from the 70's or 80's but to me, his best songs."
AEFTIUQHSVUFX_23562,"This the original and still the best version of O. Nice setting(s), decent acting, attractive people. My only gripe is the PC ending. O belongs to Sir Stephen yet she brands him? (Sorry for the spoiler.)"
AH4IX03INX4EE_17050,"Once you've established who is jaded and cool, the jokes pretty much line up and march. You may watch as long as this entertains you. The TV series is far less dated."
A2OPKSGCHMTPB1_22328,"The stories seem to be in part take-offs on old ""Star Trek"" shows.  The characters don't seem to really know each other or to have assigned roles."
A5AVTESVS28HI_22660,B movie feel but good of this kind.  You will need to be in the mood.
AV979RSVB0ENR_4910,THIS IS THE BEST BEDTIME VIDEO.  MY KIDS HAVE LOVED IT SO I BUY IT FOR EVERYONE I KNOW WHO HAS KIDS

A1KLLGG6QSPGUG_18766,I remember watching this as a kid.  It brings back many memories. Good movie for the kids to watch.  I wish there is more movies of t his on Amazon.
A3ELZ8KNK9SWM5_6624,Just another great movie by a good actor and we will continue to look for more that he has performed in
A2ET72HKBVYK5B_16563,It was a cute idea and the show was cute but no zing to make it more than ok for me.
ABBS8XHIIWT1A_17945,What a waste of Elvis's talent. 1956 songs and style are gone in these mainstream appeal to dull people movies. He must have died a little inside every time he had to make these crappy 1960s movies.
A1M77L346AP9VV_2023,my friend saw this movie when he was around 5 years old I am so glad its now available dvd
AHSURIAA1LGK2_3676,I have loved this movie since I first saw it back when it first came out.

A1LK03QPWLVTGM_2559,"Day Lewis is brilliant, as were all the cast. A classic have watched several times."
A73ONR4EAQTEB_22903,Didn't watch past about 10 minutes.  Language and lack of story were the issues.  Maxed out my F word buffer.
A34W7VYC00YVOL_17307,wish I could have watched the movie without someone talking in the back ground the whole movie
A2UZXIBPYL9HDR_14639,I had seen this movie years ago. I still enjoyed it. Very realistic about slavery and the old South. Well worth watching especially since the movie Lincoln is out now.
A2UK56VJ4F2RAK_17219,Stormy Weather is a out dated musical was great for the time when it was made. The best song in the movie was Stormy Weather.
A2580QS6AHEW7U_2682,"This is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. There is zero plot and no story line. The acting was terrible, but what can you expect from Buffy the Vampire Slayer?!"
A561KMQ9HFY96_19523,I wish there was a little more substance to the movie.  I felt there were too many awkward scenes that could have been done better.  Overall it was ok.
AVDN59PN4ILNJ_8108,It was a Christmas gift and I don't know if the person I gave it to liked it or not.
A2QTSBRRLU72X6_7156,"This is the only movie I have every seen that scared the ""B-Jezus outta me.""  Not for the faint of heart!"
A2MY0K12CMKRDM_17613,"I remember loving it when I saw it many years ago...but I'm afraid it didn't stand the test of time! Love Whoopie, didn't really love the movie!"
A9ZT45HWV8N9D_15428,This movie is about the efforts of a riding master in the oldest riding school in the world to save the schools famous Lipizan horses.
A3503JP9UTS9L7_17997,"This old cowboy movie was in poor condition, and jerked all over the screen.  It needs to be digitalized."

A2B9W1KRWF3NAP_12242,Too realist to be enjoyed very much.  We all know a couple very much this the one in this movie.
A3PNBWMORP8F5X_19848,It was a moving and insightful story. Not the most well put together movie but it was good. I didn't necessarily like it but that doesn't mean others won't.
A3QHH1ZV5S5LNI_14908,"All I can say is dynamite acting and story line. Also, this movie has a great soundtrack LP."
A15DLTUORTDFZJ_5019,This is a very good movie.  I would tell all people who enjoy old classics to consider this one.
A3DKHGGRX8DYMI_15669,"This movies okay.  Not one of the better Disney movies, but its cheap and available.  The Madam Mim scene is good."
A2ZPPR9I51TQMA_4376,bought when trumpets fade at the very reasonable price of 4.99.  really love the movie and it is remarkably realistic to me.  truly advise ww2 buffs to purchase the film.
A1HE70Y2W2W31X_7180,"Kevin Bacon was ok and so was Kathryne Erbe and there were some good creepy scenes, but the ending was a bit of a let down, makes it 3 stars instead of 4 for me."
A2QGIE0C1A8GR2_7236,"You know the movie and song entitled ""That's Entertainment""?  Well, Charlie Chaplin WAS Entertainment and Robert Downey Jr. is once again absolutely BRILLIANT.  That man is the best of the best!"
A2W4VLO3ED2Y4X_20140,"There are two DVDs in the set, labelled 1 and 2.
Both DVDs have the same content, discussion about the episode, but there is now way to actually SEE the episode.  Both DVD are filled with commentary."
A1LPLVNYE5UV69_12043,This film noir has plenty of action and humor and shows off Edward G Robinson at his dramatic best in one busy day in the life of a police captain.
A1UUNS9AD26XBG_21410,I would have really enjoyed it without promiscuous sex and filthy language. Plot was good!
A2HNLYN3B09ZG9_21405,No self respecting person could sit through this entire piece of garbage. One or two recognizable actors does not make a movie watchable.
A1G4P854040UM7_3847,I view this classic every holiday season and never tire of it. They do not make movies like this anymore. A must for all old time movie buffs.
A8MWGEB5XEOF6_10190,"One of these is WORTHLESS! It's the  Allen Arken terrible attempt to reprise Peter Sellers. There is NO plot, The dialog is inane, And the acting awful! We couldn't wait to toss it!"
AX4J292K853AQ_16466,"great skater movie that helped bring the sport into the mainstream, hard to find, especially on dvd. I'm glad I found it here"
A1R0CIANV1EPK4_13284,These movies get a little goofy as time goes on but Trek fans still love them.
A2IUAT0NF7OVTC_21678,"I don't know, for some reason I just couldn't get into this movie.  For whatever reason it just seemed to drag on, I couldn't wait for it to end!"
A36PA6MRTVYQ05_10053,"Acting was good, story only so-so IMHO.  Some surprises along the way, which is fine, but just an odd story line."
A3RGMYN9CBTLP7_15250,This replacement of an old gem was a welcome addition to my Zeppelin collection.  I know I owned this many years ago but there are a few gaps in the memory over those years lol.  Enjoy
AW7S4B6Q5DM2N_3873,"This movie is a movie you can watch every year, or every day.  It has good values in it that our family need."

A2QNVKB5572YR3_8570,"Great cast and all of them looking very young. As vampire movies go, this one is pretty good."
A2K95026HZM4FQ_374,Still funny after all these years. Takes you back to a simpler time when humor didn't involve profanity. Always have and always will enjoy this show.
A353Z3YZ5Y5DY_18772,Timothy Dalton is not my favorite Bond but he does a pretty good job in this one.  It's typical Bond action.
AI4J4FPOBVTQ7_19086,"The premise of this film is exciting...5 maniacs escape from the local mental hospital  and I think if this movie were re-made it could be pretty good. This is a slow paced early 80's slasher film. Good idea, poorly executed."
A1VVWPST3PAWUJ_9894,"Paramount should release it again....
Great Film...no problems, but poor DVD!
Do it again, and I will buy it again..."
A25RRV5IEQ8VMY_22439,Found this movie very entertaining for adults. Would not recommend for children presence. Reminded me of Grand Hotel that was a drama. Perhaps spoof of same.
ALYM2RME80UAL_23917,"An attempt to capitalize on the Eastwood Dollar trilogy, but this one just doesn't make the cut."
AAK20WWGOPUNB_14638,There was not enough depth in the characters or places. The movie ended too quickly and not enough covered for a history.
A20O1BGH7AA2BV_7717,"This is another movie where Oprah shows off her acting skills. I think she is a fantastic actor to watch and of course Danny Glover is an added treat. I watched this movie about 10 times, I love it."
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_12568,"Who would turn down a movie starring the great Charlton Heston? It's a Disaster movie part of the disaster trend of Hollywood in the 70's,it's not for everybody. It takes it's time but it's a very good movie."
A3OSPEVG76NLJ0_8545,"More depressing than anything else. A movie about struggle and then failure...and then deaths of others and manipulation. I'd rather watch Shining if i want to see ""death."""
A17LR9UBP5CRHP_223,"THIS CLASSIC IS BEAUTIFUL ! I LOVED IT AS A KID , AND NOW I LOVE IT EVEN MORE !!!!!!!"
AUKQWDUHES7PF_8128,"My son just loved this film (and so did we!).  Took a couple of its to get going, but never lost my 3 year old sons attention for the rest of the film."
A2QM6ICCAHG9R1_10603,"I won this DVD in a contest at work, so I received it free, but I still got ripped off.  This is gruesome, boring, unrealistic trash.  And that's being charitable."
AXHZLW3NY6LDG_21459,I cannot really review this dvd as for some reason it would not play on my dvd player. I know from previous experience it is a decent thirties western with a good cast.
AFEXWVSX04SI_4607,"A masterpiece!!  Pure and simple!!  I regard it as the ""unofficial"" sequel to the ""John Adams"" series, which I have the Blu Ray set as well.  Sir Anthony Hopkins portrayal of John Quincy Adams... well, see it for yourself!"
AZOW89D0NXMUT_6054,"If cameron diaz appeared more often, i would rate this movie five stars! but you only see her during 59 seconds, there is no story don't buy this unless you collect Cameron's movies
like I do.
u"
A2W1I2HVM1ZUT1_3125,The story of the Supermarine Spitfire - have seen it many times.  Great if you have not seen it - OK on the 15th time around -
A1O1UW4P6437ZO_13134,"This version is a sad joke.
The original movie gets 4 or 5 stars, this ""ultimate directors cut"" should get zero.

Here's the original:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Warriors/dp/B0000541AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Warriors</a>"
A3QA84MKOAMO9O_2842,Well done story of a family's turmoil. It was interesting to watch David Strathairn in a role so opposite of most of his roles.
A2X02RWQ8RFYUW_21904,It's not the worst kids movie but it will get on your nerves. The plot is cute but the songs are pretty bad.
A3G7H3T2FZPXFJ_16884,Very boring and poorly acted. How the West Was Won with James Arness is a far better series than this.
A3OOOEZBEKMGKE_23559,"totally fake acting and disappointed to say the least

I WANT MY MONEY BACK  CREDIT MY ACCOUNT  NOW !!!!!"
A3PEVPXZWVPFPV_13287,"Do not, I repeat DO NOT waste your time watching this film. It's poorly made and it's ""plot"" is so muddled it's kind of an insult."
A26N0LD01F9LHO_20929,Bought 2 same issue . Picture breaks up at chapter21 thru 23. Tried 2 different dvd players. Heartbreaker.
A3CDOHU96HPKA5_20019,"This was not as good as the Keys of Marinus (Story 5), but wasn't horrible. Includes episodes 27-30 of season one."
A3B19TF8BF7Z4K_5750,I was in middle school and high school during the 80's. I'm 43 years old now and The Breakfast Club still moves me now like it did then. I can watch it a hundred times and never blink.
A328C453PXKJ8B_6329,It's a great story. I love the sequence with the changing of the seasons. Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts are perfectly cast. A great love story.
A1RQH4T89Y3A2K_18605,Lithgow shines. Washington is totally over the top. Ice T steals the whole movie. Seems the director could not decide if he wanted a comedy or a drama. Unsettling.
A1IS57EEN8JGT4_9667,I bought this movie from their store and I got a defective one! Mid-way through the movie and the movie gets stuck in motion and or jumps... WTF?
A1EP7QM8VCFW81_11046,you will be on the edge of your seat at least nice during an episode.
A1H4NDRC787JAP_461,"I expected more or maybe I was expecting something like Downton Abbey.  Was enjoyable, but was somewhat disappointed.  I'll watch it...only once."
A90ER724KRNN_6101,Love the mix of love story and baseball!  It is a movie I watch over and over again.
A3TAJK8NHVE3J_8430,"this is a good movie if you want to learn about Math. It is a must see, some may consider it a requirement for any math student."
ADCNVR02KHNZ8_21243,I generally love classic movies. However not this one. The singing just didn't fit and it was annoying. I would have liked more emphasis on the characters. I would not watch this movie again.
ASOUMMJO9S3M5_15037,good story but not up to Robert Redford's standards or Faye Dunaway for that matter. I have seen it before so may effect my opinion.
A37QSOVKGPY9TZ_21594,"As expected, not the best movie of The Lone Ranger but entertaining and finally a widescreen presentation that makes it much more worth the watch. Very pleased."
A2PFOKV9W9BXWJ_10835,These older movies are rich in humor and have an air of dignity not found in the movies of today. You got to love this pre-world war II movie starring Jimmy Stewart.
A1ZYETNHGDUY8E_3691,"We thought we were ordering the COLORIZED version - as  the advertisement is placed directly under the COLORIZED version - misleading..  Have returned it to the seller, as per instructions.  Thank you."
A3TLXTXD8PHVIF_6318,"What's not to like about these movies.  My kids still love them, even as teenagers.  They like to watch them over and over."
A32L4XEPPXTW1E_8940,Good to see this version as I had forgotten it. But I expected a hard copy not just access thru firestick.
A1IG8EPARK4HNM_15336,"Where's the WS version (preferably anamorphic) of this wonderful movie ? ? ?

Or is Amazon listing the screen format of 1.33:1 by mistake ?"
A27ZZVZ5GQ65HI_16522,love this movie but the last fifteen minutes of the original movie are missing and it looks like a copy and not original movie should have said the last 15 minutes of the movie is what is missing
A7MJHIU2YPCFA_4397,This was one of my favorite movies growing up it is just as i remembered it very cool highly recommended
A1O2GJF5MOTLQF_16184,"very entertaining movie with legendary actors plus great supporting actors, one of my favorite movies"
A3LVGDZX6XQBC2_17180,Cheesy and predictable. Marie Osmond has a great voice but never was an actress. Big yawn!
A1ZF7A69FMGBUD_17802,It was an interesting variation to the regular Cinderella story. She was quite a feisty character. Also it seemed strange for her to have the France accent. But I loved the ballet sequence. It was beautiful.
A58764FGNW2DR_21014,"This is not a bad movie, but not a tremendously good one though either. Remember it as a kid. if you are a collector, then it is worth it."
A1C3Z0YG6KJ9FP_14888,"I loved it when I was a younger mother, watching it again at 54 not as funny"
A2LZ7NKENSECA1_9324,Looks great in HD on my new LG GA7900. Looks great from my ROKU on my older LG 42 inch LCD also.
A3EEHAIAB1O0KA_10978,I can only state History Will Decide as there will never be 'today' any consensus.
A1T4B1N0LJMAVG_3516,"This is one of the worst movie that I ever seen. The story is boring, doesn't make sense.
Casts were ok,cheap production."
A3XFJDMRPM37O_19751,"I really don't understand the love given this film.  The effects are bad, the acting is cheesy and the plot is neither good nor original.  Sometimes cheese can be fun, but this has very little entertainment value."
A269Y1CVKD1DZL_18610,"If you saw the TV mini-series, you will be disappointed with this severely edited version.  The case is a fascinating case to study.  There are many books about the subject that are much better than this edited movie."
A1E9M48G2358DW_9777,"The movie was good, but the video kept cutting out. That was a pain, amazon gave a refund with out asking. Way to go Amazon!"
A3MGWN066NOFDZ_303,"This movie is corny and just fun. With improved technology of today, I would love to see a remake. A comic book comes to life."
AMB8HJY1YFEC6_1227,We enjoyed this movie when it originally came out.  It was fun to watch although pretty unrealistic in this day and age.
A3IK0M7CRXRQG5_9485,"Although just a bit north of ""Spaghetti Western"" quality, and somewhat hard to believe, this true story of actual happening's, was quite enjoyable. I thought the intrigue portions to be just a little overdone, but is understandable, all things considered."
A1DCOL3ANWTGKW_6105,insane cast featuring future stars and an amazing soundtrack. It inspired hazing across the country... A staple for gen x'ers everywhere.
A2WPRFT3JUQ6U3_16232,This movie spent too much time on the story line and not enough action with the monsters. I love Godzilla movies but this one was never one of my favorites
A2XKRTDDV4JCRN_13008,I just love Eddie Murphy in Beverly hill cop so funny and fun. If you are a fan then this is the place to get your copy.
A2016LURVI9FS_1190,I'm a big Demi Moore fan. She does an awesome job in this movie. Love it.
A3I7FK2S7BTEWW_5760,"This movie is great!  When you put all these kids together you find out one thing and that is they are all the same, one way or another :)"
AJXPU0XOW4B2S_13693,Love the music.  Love the dancing.  We watched the Intern which made several references to this movie resulting in our watching it the following night.  Let me suggest that our path be followed.
A3U4HT2D0AGPTT_22751,"love the move, but whom ever did the colorization and restoration didn't do a very good job, the VHS color version I have is way clearer"
A3TFZ3SALUMEUL_1222,"The classic that is fantastic... it's no top gun, but it doesn't try to be. This is a kids fantasy movie set in real life.

Great fun for anyone who misses the 80s."
ABQR5ZDH37TFE_17535,"It wasn't to bad for an old movie. To Nancy Reagan in it was a wow. She was a beauty.  It's fun watching the classics. If you're a fan of the old ones, you may enjoy this - I did."
A3MOJSA8HC2BIF_7609,"Great Movie, great Transfer on Blu-Ray.

Region Coded for Region A only

Will not work overseas, unless you have an American Region A Player."
A2KWMEQ4EO0RX2_18813,I know I love this movie but it just would not play on my DVD player.  I was so disappointed.  Sellers should let you know if the movies are only for a certain geographic area.
AAP1JDX401YTC_21374,I wanted to see this because when it was being made I saw Jay Silverheels and Johnny Crawford. They were doing a promo for the movie. So maybe not a great movie. Just wanted to finally see it.
AR9BKHMMNI62Z_2931,"Beautiful movie... one of those, so you judge this way? Well, what about this perspective... type stories.  Well done, well scripted, well acted, and excellently directed."
ABO0PB16GMPNW_1938,one of my essential films. the scene at the chinese restaurant between robin williams and amanda plummer is worth the entire price of admission. improvisation at its best. hilarious.
A139R1VPHUMTEO_23134,"An amusing bit of fluff from the thirties.  Gives a slightly slanted  view of the movie business
For audiences who were curious about an American ""institution"" ."
AT2RN15SYB0KK_9352,"I got  the impression by the way this was presented, that this also had the colorized version included - m0st disappointed that it does not  Other than that, service was ne."
A24YEQSCZIO1TM_10524,It was okay.  Pretty slow for an action movie and some of the acting was bad.  But you've got to love Chuck!
AYWSFRCIMOAYE_9412,"The acting is below average. The movie tries to be funny but it's so forced that it's not.

Clint Eastwood is much better in other movies."
A4Z3XZW4SIE32_6535,I deleted this one early on as I didn't understand it.  Maybe I didn't stock with it long enough.
A359E0BH27GP7Q_21316,"This was a fair movie, it was hard to piece together at times but still an enjoyable watch. Thank you."
A3MJOVF3SEYAB7_15645,"I seen this movie a long time ago when I was younger and I liked it. I like the cast, Andrew, Jamie and Robert. it's kind of a sad but truthful story. it's a good movie."
A3QSTIHCISMTL3_15587,Very good movie. Bette Davis has always amazed me. She can pull off just about any role the movie requires her to play.
A3O0QU9M0GQOG2_21393,This film features a young Tom Hanks. The most interesting bit for me is that he randomly wore one red shoe during part of it. There are some funny bits and the ending is good.
A20568D9GRC08W_13333,"Like the other Friday the 13th's, this movie is cheesy and predictable. Still, it's pretty enjoyable. I love the Jason movies and if you do too you'll enjoy this one."
A1KALHQD4LWAKO_5175,"Outstanding family-oriented drama featuring a lazy southern town that suffers from more than summer heat as a young brother and sister learn how quickly the innocence of childhood is lost.
Very highly recommended."
A3L044JLWY92WI_23706,"Poor quality, not a very good movie.  You could not see the movie, frizzed and the overall quality of the picture was extremely poor as well as audio.  Amazon should not sale this poor quality items"
A14U42QUWC9HBR_169,This movie is very thoughtful and insightful in the portrayal of Joseph of Egypt. I would highly recommend this movie to all.
A37UJFECZS0ZNM_4504,"where else can you find Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo as female impersonators.  The story line alone would have you interested weather or not the characters are men dressed as women.  Packing and shipment were both excellent."
A11T18BLTSAJ6M_23091,"Many of the movies I get from here are what I want, this one fit the Bill and I am happy."
A3PS8H6NYE037T_15479,This is a  poor acting version of the movie.  The BBC version with Colin Firth is much more superior.  Also the movie version is better. This is the worst version I've seen.
A1XVBYSHN5HYXR_10823,"Special Edition... Ha give me the originals thankyou very much.
George Lucas forgot how to make movies... as seen by the new ones."
A2VHIP7PR1B61Y_13543,"I haven't viewed many a ""classic"" Star Trek movie (read: this is the first one I've ever seen), but I loved this movie.  It was cheesy, it had overacting, it was great.  Genesis Project-what's that?"
A3OQ1OATK5FQ04_3283,"A very funny DVD with Leslie Nielsen If you like screw ball comedy's, this is a must for your collection. Nuff said."
A2LEO2H9ZQAI1W_1720,Annie is a timeless classic that captures the hearts of children with its message of how love can soften even the hardest heart.
AGYQERG3OEPR8_7629,Both movies are great disney classics old yeller 1957 and savage sam 1963 both have tommy kirk and kevin corcoran lots of bonus features in this package
A1ZDTIVZA9R8G4_20904,"Mighty Ducks was pretty dumb but this movie is extra dumb. The Ducks are already the champions, why should we root for them? Plus Iceland is a terrible place for hockey."
A2QU9JG7KQWAIO_7394,couldn't hear it.  it was recorded on too low a volume to hear. It is a great film if you could hear it.
A179D8LPMCGP9W_17401,"what a nonsense, waist of money, and time, totally not what expected for a vampire movie, don't waist your money and time on it."
A1SZO00HH7XD3H_1663,Captures her struggles and triumphs well. At the end you get the message. She is a mentally ill woman being completely raked over the coals and taken advantage of by the system. She eventually succumbs to a hideous fate.
AMQDC2C0A9F18_7944,It is very cute and a different twist to fairy tales NYC is such a good back drop for the story.
ABDAIWBQS362P_7840,This was not the entire film.  It was missing several scenes that were in the original release.  I am somewhat disappointed.
AA6UX9H3CKO59_19229,The storyline was quite good but the actors appeared somewhat wooden and unbelievable.  Amusing enough to watch the whole thing but don't expect great art...more like a pilot for a sitcom that didn't make the cut.
A35HGQBLSG7XRJ_20174,I bought this thinking it was It Came From Outer Space with Richard Carlson.  It is not that movie.  It is a lame documentary.
A1NURAG6OMQ4L9_3579,5 star movie that looks FANTASTIC on blu-ray. Should be in very movie lover's collection. We love both the color and B&W version. They did a very nice job colorizing it. We typically alternate the two versions each Christmas time.
A2L7XA4B5MTPDT_4498,"This movie is about three drag queens that go on a road trip to Hollywood. This movie will make you laugh so hard, you'll cry."
A10SRQGTNLE957_8900,I like how this movie is done. It is kind of how you would expect the old west was.
AS7CWNEYCALMY_18416,the extras are cool. like the part where they show the movie. that's a cool extra from the previews
A36C1AC79655QU_8884,"One of Morgan Freeman's best roles. The acting by everyone was superb. The tension builds and just when you think it's over, there's a twist. The ending has to be seen to be believed."
AE4WCVUWS70HC_22840,"Stupid story, overdone and unnecessary violence. Painful to watch at times as it veers from a promising beginning."
A21RF1ENTVPM9C_6621,This is a wonderful movie and have seen it since it came out and still love it till now. Can really relate to it
A3GH786WSGN0Q8_7011,This movie is a classic haunted house story. It has all the makings of a real ghost story. Worth seeing!
AOBJJ7EFHWSCA_15698,"The story is plausible to a point. The actors acting was very good, they sold their lines. The writers on the other hand let the story flop."
A3A3U4V4Y3M3L1_8403,"Uneven. Good in spots, unconvincing in others. At times a bit pretentious even for a genius. I also felt too emotionally manipulated. Is higher math even more stupendous than a good blow job? I'm impressed. I think."
A3AJSON8SXXBX5_14495,this is one scary movie i like it the movie is very good i bought it on blu-ray but i was very disappointed there were no extras just the movie .
A3AXIVYKIA642N_11349,"George Burns plays both the devil and God.  It's a cute movie with good acting.  I didn't enjoy it as much as the first two ""God"" movies starring George Burns, but it's worth seeing."
A33JNOJGYC1ZVR_2589,"Pretty good movie.  Great cast.  It was nice to see that no scandal actually occurred, don't see many movies that go that way anymore.  May not be juicy enough for some viewer but nice family entertainment."
ABVO9ZVBYRB6A_22431,"Pretty fun, but not family-friendly at all. Won't let our teens or college kids see it."
A2N5YDI1V4GU2P_1378,"One of my absolute favorite horror movies from my youth, as well as an awesome soundtrack."
A1E2VCK48GIFZ3_9517,I had no idea I'd like this as much as I do. I just might be a redneck.
AVXYGPXPUG88H_4799,I had never watched the movie and did not know the plot.  Good movie with some surprises
A32DTCFBBB9WIV_22838,"Do you wonder why this movie is being sold by 5.99 only? Because it's a bad deal. The film is absurd, weak. I guess even Arnold doesn't remember it!"
A2F1P8F8I5B1ZO_12928,Made for a very enjoyable evening! There were some tense moments. This was a good made up story to fit in with original Sherlock Holmes stories and tried to give a way for Sherlock and Watson were ever introduced.
ADNLG53C3W0EG_12441,LOVE RICK SPRINGFIELD AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  I LOVE THOSE CHESSY 80'S MOVIES.  THANK YOU THANK YOU
A3M4FAZ29WK4WU_17799,I LOVE the story. Leslie Caron and Michael Wilding do well in their respective roles- BUT the quality of this DVD is very very disappointing. Lots of noise.
A1W8KACWQ7BCRK_18791,It's ok as magic stories go but some of the characters were rather unbelievable like something out of Saturday Night Live and you could pretty much tell that the dragon was fake. A rather low budget movie but still cute.
A261ZLNLNRU6SD_3993,"This is an excellent product, a good reproduction of a classic Christmas movie.  My family and I will look forward to viewing this year after year!"
A2CF10QQVLBTLI_9430,I haven't seem this movie for years and even though I knew the ending the excitement of the chase was still thrilling. Harrison Ford  and Tommy Lee Jones were wonderful foes.
A281XUNV59DHVK_8960,"Missed the R rating and was appalled during the first 5 minutes. Apparently we have only ever seen the cut tv version. Can't tell you anything more as to quality, etc. because we turned it off."
A2W39GGRWSFU7K_18366,I got this thinking it was the last Robin Hood made with 'the Gladiator' guy.
A2HSM08XTMUKO3_11429,"First I want to say that the DVD came promptly and in great condition.
The movie was fun and I adore Maggie Smith.  It was fun to see her at an earlier age than when she played in Harry Potter."
A1UD8BODQ1P8TL_15722,"Didn't care for the ending, but it was realistic and followed logically from the plot line."
AATXRNK8U1XHD_21789,I couldn't even watch the video without it freezing up and I had to keep refreshing it!! Will never buy rented videos from Amazon again!
A25K9NC6TSW0JZ_16023,Movie is a little dark for my taste. Might buy another version as this one is also a little hard to understand as accents are thick.
A2GT89YH31GLWC_6792,"A thinking person's movie for the intellectually lazy.  Shallow and derivative, with fairly good acting and nice perfume-commercial style visuals...  Not to be taken seriously, but still fairly entertaining."
AN2N97XEH04S2_9470,Am interesting movie about the Navy and some retired guys helping out when officials are stymied in their need for some action on a task they are not able to get done themselves.
A20ZPKPVFOFH0H_9752,"there are a few scary moments but harrison fords performance was fantastic I promise you no more than nonstop adventure, fun, and entertainment."
A2RC88M5FS2WX5_7368,I bought this movie because Jane Fonda was in it  (Wearing a Bikini in it) Sorry I have a think for Jane Fonda!!!!
A9KTGMFIM2V49_9781,Good old fashion fighting navy movie with multiple star cast. black & white but you really don't notice.
A1GD1G8XXPRYQ8_18287,Jesus. No. I barely made it to half the movie. Nothing like new MLP series. THANK GOD!
A2J7IA24KAAJ03_9142,Two great actors you would never think to cast together.  But they make a great movie together.  I have watched several times.
ASNRLMM0DORFO_8077,my daughter watches this movie at least 5 times a day. no scratches and plays great!
A15S6MWFAZVDY4_23937,Unless you are a fan of very old movies you can pass on this one.  Dialogue is stilted and silly.  A time waster for us.
A3551HVDHA2NPY_15865,"There was plenty happening, I liked the monsters, the psychic folks were an interesting gimmick, but nothing was really explained and there seemed little reason for the villains actions."
A2VJE4JXC3KIWH_19990,"i purchased this vhs for the second, at least this one plays. Very poor video. I hope it comes out on the dvd format."
A2Z9I19GOW3O1U_8662,"It's worth watching, It makes you wonder maybe sometime in the future it could happen, i would recommend this movie."
A1AHWIJ7HSYSVL_21079,I thought this movie was great back when it came out and I watched it with my two small children.  I watched it again recently and still thought it was a good flick.
A3FEX9SZ1CZIZ7_23732,"I totally hate this movie. There were these singing cats that sang :""Everybody! Everybody! Everybody wants to be a cat! Everybody! everybody! Everybody wants to be a cat!"" Its about cats and pleased me when i was 5."
A36DKZXJ0WUVMB_17900,We had been talking about this movie for awhile and wanted to see it again.  Not as funny as I remembered but was cute.
AZULZL885KZ71_11217,The story line was fatalistic with too much sexual emphasis in the plot.  The plot direction was pretty predictable except for the extra sick result at the end.  I like the actors - but this was not their best showing.
A7RI661VKFJGW_17469,"There were so many bad things about this movie. The acting was Horrible! The film quality was so bad, and it was freaking Boring!!"
A1RBUJPWZ4RHIM_15062,"Unadulterated and unapologetic shmalz. Sometimes it's just what the doctor ordered! My wife, who had never seen it, was charmed from beginning to end."
A2HOFULXES0ERQ_5674,Love this movie!! An oldie but goodie!! Item was as described! Great condition. With winter here this is a great movie to watch with popcorn!!
A1H41G83KM6JH7_10281,Originally saw this on Netflix and loved it so much i bought it. Great movie for any horror collectors set!!!!
A7JAVM3JDL7BG_12347,wonderful suspense story. Great to see Sissy and jack working together. David Clennon makes a great nasty guy.
A1Z3MZXD1V0TFT_17218,This was a gift for my husbands birthday and he loved it.  I do not care for comedy movies and this one does not make me laugh.
A3TF01UB2MJ5QB_15675,Fun fantasy film for the whole family. A Disney classic which my kids just love. We got it quickly and in great working order.
A2JUFRAQPBY263_10651,"Don't even waste your time with this one, it was a horrible movie.  Yes, the soundtrack was good--the background music-- but this production is on the level of a Disney Network show produced for teenagers.  Not worth your time."
A2UL4EJ30U6FAC_23558,"It was a cute but not great family movie.  My 6 and 9 year old said it was ""ok""."
A3OWWWFSDOD5AC_6794,Did I say how much I love cult classics? This movie is always ready to play.
A2OHXPMYNHP1N3_16996,Good trip down memory lane; fun watching vintage movie about college kids and spring break.
A351NB8VZHU0SN_4524,"A unique role change for each of these classic actors! Rest in Peace Swayze, we miss you now and forever."
ARBJ2KTHX1WCL_23317,"I was not disappointed with the historical correctness of the clothing.  The costumes were great.  However, some of the actors and their story lines were boring and sub-par.  Ending was like a dangling rope."
A4T5G02Z1XNBF_15453,"Yes, this a great Disney movie.  Unfortunately it is technically poor in
quality, which made the children watching it, lose interest.  Too bad."
AXSES4EXE179H_20036,This movie was not filmed in 3-D. This release is computer generated and manipulated. They are placing two slightly offset images in a stereo window and it does not have true depth.
A1SWLQMDCKOZHU_16443,The movie looked as if someone had tried to duplicate the movie and the quality and color was pretty poor.
A3TJ9NCZKS46LL_13447,"Somehow this movie seemed really dated.  I remember loving it when it came out like twenty years ago, but seeing it again was a big disappointment."
A2U97DWUJICZHX_6681,"One of Goldy's best comedies. Good pairing with Steve. keeps us laughing. Wouldn't want to live with her! I think I watch it for the house, I could live in that!!"
A3MTVI686NPUV_13531,Classic comedy.  Old school.  Most of the material will go over younger minds.  Love the prop plane sounds coming from a jet.
A3UL00RH3B9MMC_4962,Terrible format.  Go buy this movie on Blu-ray.  Why would you even look at HD DVDs anyway? Blu-ray won the format wars.
A37BTY4CMCORUL_13722,I see kids dressing this way again and it just reminded me of the movie.  So we had to watch with my daughter.
A1YIDHEPVCBOI6_10279,Love this movie. Usually an action/adventure sci fi guy. Been watching this one since a little kid.  ONLY musical I really enjoy. Tradition.
A82Q2SP65Y14X_14451,never got the chance to watch all it there was a blurriness so I didn't get to see all of it
A2KZRBAX8FE75Q_620,I thoroughly enjoyed this action packed movie.  Harrison Ford is amazing in this movie.  Thank you.
A3I9R5ORZHUMFA_6251,Love everything about this movie. Hugh Grant is excellent in this role as is the entire cast
A1T2KGH07IV3XE_3601,Who doesn't love Cary Grant with Deborah Kerr? Add a little Mitch and it's a wonderful feast for the eyes. Highly recommend.
A34JCWMB67UIIK_18761,"Not the best WWII drama but it isn't the worst either.  Rather superficial, formulaic, glamorized version of US spies in Nazi Germany.  War was never as pretty as depicted in the film."
A1IC3X0EW86EUZ_1034,I loved this movie. The interaction of the characters was heart felt. I recommend this movie. The actors were great.
A2RT3ALS62WES1_7936,"peasant girl, meets prince, chased off by evil queen, finds her happily ever after any ways

good family film, young 5-6 and under my not sit still for it, but great for your slightly older set of kids."
A1A6DECQAWS54O_4842,"With everyone reading this book and Go Set a Watchman, I wanted to see this movie (again).  I suppose the movie technique is dated but it is the original movie and won a lot of awards at the time."
AV1KYJXHOWPMD_22321,"If this were released on a better disk with better special effects, this would very much be worth the price. Other than that, it is an okay buy, but it needs much improvement."
A94QJ3Z8G7936_20307,"It's OK.  I'd only recommend it for die-hard Gleason fans.  Except for Gleason and Carney, the acting is terrible."
A1CLEK0B5C7UIW_20611,"Terrible, its one of those movies that they went to Samuel L Jackson and said there's this s*** movie and... and he just cuts them off and says I'll do it..."
A1XZLFKL7AR25R_17178,One of my favorite 80s movies of all time.  C. Thomas Howell is awesome.  Peter Horton seems to shine here apart from his role on Thirtysomething.  Also Courtney Thorne-Smith is here as well and hotter than ever.
A3NJBBW8WYUTB1_5587,Excellent movie about Bruce Lee. True to life. It is one of my favorite movies that I watch again and again.
A9MR81J2M63FF_15743,"All 14 of these are timeless classics, and will never be surpassed by CGI and special effects..."
A204YSQQXSZ6QS_19120,"I realize this goes against many other views, but I thought it was just awful."
A3RQ7O1QKLNCI6_1682,SINATRA AT HIS GREATEST-THIS IS ROLE HE WANTED MOST AND NO ONE-ABSOLUTELY NO ONE COULD HAVE DONE IT BETTER.
AFEQG2A7K9V6F_7456,Doris Day show are refreshing compared to today's shows.  I love the comedy story lines and she had the top of the line actors on her show.  I cannot stop laughing.
A2CT3GSDKWME0B_18927,"ABSOLUTELY the most pathetic movie ever made ! And I am an old ""Baby-Boomer"", who remembers this movie then...and now. It was STUPID then, and it's even more STUPID today ! Just AWFUL acting....horrible writing....just AWFUL !"
AG5AT27MGW5V0_18955,"VERY CHESSE MOVIE..... ACTION AND BAD INSIDE JOKES......IN MY DAY ROGER MOORE WAS THE SIANT!!

ACTION ACTION ACTION ACTION ACTION"
AU0A69I7CGRF8_21482,"The image says it all. This movie is the worst of the TMNT series for sure. Kids MIGHT like it, but not after watching the amazing first movie made by Jim Henson and the alright second movie that followed."
A1Z3ZQE7IRTKUE_8700,"Ordered to watch with my teen daughters for a little history lesson (I know, Oliver Stone's perspective). My older daughter got more out of the experience than the younger. Younger one's eyes glazed over about half way thru."
A5122RHVY7QMD_15551,One of my favorite movies. I used it in my human development class to create discussion about nature vs nurture.
AR76PUQUF023T_19559,"I liked it better many years ago.  Today watching a man dress up like a woman to advance his career is ridiculous.  Come to think of it, it was ridiculous back then too.  Men still rule the world."
A25EVUQYJ5B40T_22059,"Lame, low budget and cringingly bad. I am amazed it generated enough interest for several sequels, all of which were better than this movie."
A2WYC9GANC4JC2_20619,It was OK and it had a few funny parts but I guess I was expecting more from this movie. The action was decent but over all I had to give it three stars.
AJWZ3KPP9DTAG_10081,Predictable ending and dull story telling.  Nothing wrong with the acting.  Problem is with the poor script.  The suspense is too contrived.
A342MAAR9XCEG6_19126,"Never saw this when it was in theaters.  Heard a lot about it and was curious.  Got bored and didn't finish watching it.

Maybe it will grow on me like it obviously has for so many others."
A2SQQEBFON8DN4_13649,"Waste of time. Although it tried to stay true to characters we watched in Popeye cartoons as children, present generation didn't understand.  Hard to understand voices."
A3SRURTVIMSVO_3591,"I don't celebrate Christmas, but I can't start my holiday without this feel good movie. Fabulous!"
A2Q420FBJ6UNAO_10854,Love this movie but after watching it for the first time in years I do notice that it's looking old ..especially the robotic wolf..lol
A2KWTGTH249Y58_12070,"Apart from the heroine's endless screaming, it all conveys Wyndham's sci-fi nightmare with good cumulative tension. Kieron Moore is a bit wooden."
A3O8N35W0F6ZP7_545,I have seen it before so I did not see the whole thing but it is worth seeing. If you like unreal stuff it is good fantasy
A230KTXI62MSYU_15561,"good drama and acting i seen this picture many years ago, I will buy it only in widescreen and blu-ray"
A146TY3Q5Y95QE_9823,There were some plot elements that I could have done without.  They needed to leave them out or develop them more.
A3B167OS0BI0RN_18445,What a horrible movie on the Smurfs.  One of the few times where the movie is worse than the TV spinoffs.
AEEYOXJ3BYWOC_16051,We have slowly accumulated many many many versions of the Charles Dickens Christmas Carol.  This animated version was o.k. but not one of our top ten.
A3QEL7WYBR8WXB_17443,country kid goes to big city  stupid ending like really you couldn't do better than that?
A1GGCD668RKK84_16702,"First watch Sleepless in Seattle, then this, and fast forward through the lame musical numbers at the end, and it's a perfect movie."
A2R9CQUBXWK7WP_16623,"Well produced and fairly accurate to the actual accounts.  Raul Julia does an excellent job portraying  Oscar Romero.  Caution, the ending is quick  and  brutally descriptive.  Highly recommend and would purchase as a gift."
A2GGE373E69OYJ_11022,"First few minutes were enough to make me know this was not at all the kind of movie I wanted to see, and certainly not fit for the family."
A1BVUIQFPKWEZE_19455,"The story is ok BUT remember...this is not closed captioned at all...and no subtilties either. If you are hard of hearing, pass this up."
A1KER696C6CSDQ_9805,i just watch a movie for entertainment  value.. ..i let the star rating speak for itself.. ..it is that simple
A6FH8LMP30NYJ_20201,"Interesting tale, but not the best Sherlock ever portrayed.  Nicol Williamson in the 7% Solution was my favorite.  Film was too slow in developing."
A3UL5EQ5FKVK2O_12876,This is a pretty good movie but not quite a five-star rating.  I love almost any movie about Sherlock Holmes and you will enjoy this one.
A19WUIBB4UH92D_23528,"My tastes in movies has definitely changed as I age.

I thought I really had liked this movie when I saw it years ago, but not so much now.

Don't really know why, just did not feel it."
A1A8BHFVJFJOC8_10437,As usual Robert De Niro did an excellent job of acting.  The plot was weak and way too many unrealistic car chase scenes to make even somewhat realistic.
AN4UGECMFIEUG_20089,Strange film. Alec Guinness could not save it. Not sure if it was a dark comedy or a tragedy with a few laughs.
A17V9GK7J63NIN_10746,"it was alright, but i can't say it was better or as good as the first. i strongly recommend watching the first, then watching the second."
AWJLPT74JQALE_22612,"The original movie many long years ago was great too much same old thing. I only watched 10 minutes, boring, very old hat...Get a life fellahs. Make something new and surprise us!"
A170DUI1VKRPCQ_16892,"A heart warming view of the ""... love ones back home.""  The right mix of drama, comedy, and the usually hanky moments. This movie has the usual war story line of separated families during hard times.  Very good movie."
AYCEJK425WK3Q_19865,"I saw this film when I was young, and the memory of it stuck in my mind.  Although upon a second viewing, I realize that the movie is not that great, it is still nostalgic for me."
AIBAYOIGYDQDZ_4880,"Would buy again from this seller.  Item arrived quickly, and in condition described.
Thanks so much!"
A3EFT3OMWYR0C2_14974,transaction went smoothly.  purchased for my spouse who is a fan and was very pleased with the addition to our collection
A2RE8SSA94GWW9_17017,"This was an okay movie.  Think I purchased it in a package of movies from the 1950's. If you enjoyed living during the fabulous 50's, then you will like this movie."
A33NMLHEVU1FT0_15523,I loved it way back when but times have changed and so has the humor. Didn't find it funny at all this time from what I had remembered.
A2WZ0PLRB89VDG_22278,"From the promos, I thought this was going to be right up my intellectual alley.  But it turns out to be all about obscurantism, with an entertainment value of zero."
A22UN4KOSQ4K8W_4490,I love this movie. It is a very cute move.  The guys play their parts perfectly.  And it is so funny.
A2MD9AL0CBAUOW_1275,Do not understand how I put off seeing it for so long--finally had to be nudged by my grandchildren.
AELXRFUOBKUYM_1484,"I would recommend this to Resident Evil fans. It does not follow too closely to the games but has some similar scenes. Not a bad sequel, overall 4 stars."
A2VA5AH4YCFB77_23248,"The plot is sometimes too predictable.
the esthetics in production are really cool, meaning hairdoes and outfits, landscapes are cool too
the rest of the cast is very mediocre"
A1V176RDEFNDXO_16386,"Good show, enjoyable, made me laugh. Had Dickensonian tragic humor as well.
The acting of Micheal Caine was great, even better than Ben Kingsley.
Cheers."
A3L0ETU7FVIPV9_13152,"Well, I got to admit it is not the best movie from these guys.
Lucky for me that I friend of mine bought from me. Didn't like very much..."
ASMZR17QAI82W_16682,Mad cap comedy! Very funny....watch as people add 1 + 1 and come up with 3....or 4!
A3C4TNPDQXC48S_21911,Don't care for the disco moves and music.  I don't have this one any more.
A374HQESYR9N5Q_6522,"I admit this movie had me guessing was she crazy or was she really dreaming the future? But anyway, it keeps your attention but the ending was predictable. Overall I would recommend."
AGGPXI0SS9GUK_4727,Well made action movie - everyone gives good performance. I have been thought that tunnel in the past - don't want to go again after this movie=HA!!
AVKFH4H4GBU5K_11980,Billy Bob Thornton is just brilliant in his roll. You just got to love the...huhaa's!!
A3UZ44WYSHU7GT_18279,"Those were the days...

Plot is a little thin, but the kids (teenagers) enjoyed the glimpse at true 70's ""retro"" and the music is awesome."
A26RKIQHBBR8OP_11111,"While it did a good job showing some of the areas where it is thought Jesus was born, was crucified, and rose again, the narration is slow and in somewhat the manner of ""whispering in church""."
A1SZPVDMQGSWX5_12228,"Very interesting, I could see an Alien race doing something along these lines. But it did get a bit weird in places. Good to see the old Slide Rules in use, I still have mine."
A16E3JYBOQT0HQ_12907,"The acting and directingis a bit sketchy butt the storyline resonates with current events. It's a classic for Dan Akroyd and you get to marvel at Al Franken, now a senator from Minnesota."
A2BJT63CP6QJ0Y_3168,Not as entertaining as hoped for.  Picture quality good for such an old film but fun to watch.  Rare footage.
A3KZV2BYMS7HGO_4216,"It was a good watch; a little slow at times, but a mind teaser too."
A2RI2906M3N0N8_3893,This was purchased for a women's dorm on a college campus. They loved this classic flick and it's frequently checked out of the movie library.
A3EBQORE3ZS29V_20022,"The best thing about this movie was the cinematography.  The plot, acting, etc. was only  marginally pedestrian."
A27EB7VJYKX09P_22797,"The movie itself is one of the best ever made but the disc skips repeatedly. It goes straight from chapter 11 to chapter 14, causing you to skip everything in between."
A1UPQKV2I92Z00_9165,"Thought-provoking and intelligent humor. Not only did I laugh, but it made me think about the choices I have made in my own life and determine to do better. Well written, well acted, well worth viewing."
A1BL65ZJPWJW5J_18017,"It's coming out again soon.  If your a fan, don't worry.  It's still a POS film."
AFX3Q6G3IZNX2_14757,"This is a silly movie, and Barbra is SO miscast. Bring on Carol Channing, the greatest Dolly of all! But a great long note at the end of the first part!!! You go, Streisand..."
A1ATGE991ELK0U_16523,"I love this remake of the 1975 Fench film. I've been waiting for this film to come out on DVD for a few years. With William Petersen playing the cheating husband, I almost forgot him as Gil Grissom, almost."
A3AZ2RTIGMNONZ_12659,"this pathetic, insufferable piece of garbage defiled one of the most creative, original and brilliant comic books of all time -- steve gerber's seminal howard the duck. seek out the comics (ebay?), shun the ""film""."
A2XMY20IDZW29_2409,Very good movie. And while set in the future not so unbelievable well played and compelling.
A2QFX8XTIOLDH4_9456,The whole nine yards is actually a surprisingly good comedy after a shakey start the plot develops then you've got a good film until the end it's worth seeing or renting out.
A1MOCNP2U0Y193_23589,This was not t feel good movie - I guess it could bolster ones with low self esteem but for me it was just sad.
A225KN1Y2I7DFO_11879,"It was difficult to follow, I will watch it again.  A much needed message to get out there.  Tom horn is filled with much needed knowledge."
A11IZDVGUBA7UY_6378,"a classic, Boris karloff was the original  monster. I watched it over and over again as a kid along with Bella Lugosi as the vampire"
AAM5BCE9FZVAJ_18409,"The set up for the plot takes about an hour, and the ""funny"" typical Ball moments were stuck into 30 mins."
A1LPI4XRNUR0T6_18686,"I love Reese Witherspoon, but this movie was really lame. There was no story line. The boy and older sister were very unlike able and it was hard to sympathize with them."
A3V1P580Y1HG6B_1676,"Starts off with great battles, drama, everything you could want!  But after a while, you just want it to end.  Interesting enough to rent.....only to rent."
A4B90YSK5IAKM_13126,I don't mind re-makes of old movies but at least don't make them so obvious and predictable
A1863FWX3KULDN_1482,I would have to say this is the best resident evil movies plenty of action and milla is at the top of her game beautiful as always
A2418ZET66CQ0N_11991,"Interesting movie, not much of a plot as it didn't take long to figure our what was coming."
A3VCFT79MUHD95_13213,Screwball comedy at it's best with the director who turned it into an art form.
A3NLRA0IECQQLA_22646,The filming was poor to say the least. Characters were on dimensional and poorly cast! Had to turn it off!
A2HVIFUBKOD3P4_23592,"This one pales in comparison to the original, but if Bronson is in it, we'll watch."
A1BEB85K72UXXC_4388,"Good movie.  You can definitely see that this movie probably had an influence for the later ""I Dream of Jeannie"" show."
A1PP7GQZPE9UQ6_14120,"Bittersweet love story, with a secondary love story of an older couple. Redford does ""rom-com"" quite well."
A2S4Y1150E6R44_3522,Don't miss this movie...it is great. The movie is complete with humor and sadness and it is done in a great combination. I would recommend this movie to everyone.
A3MIZBAZL7GK4Y_267,very important exercises are presented here. not just kegel but other such as squats. i think in general these are great to do on a regular basis.
A1ZR99J533EP28_17586,"I thought this was a silly movie. I don't know what I thought I was expecting... but while 2001 made sense, 2010 didn't seem to do that."
A2GR51JVMT8W9M_9363,Well written with an unexpected  ending. But I felt a sense of completion. Paul Newman's humor was great. Worth watching.
A30L0M4KXJB7AD_15420,"If you like the sixties, you'll revel in glorious Audrey Hepburn and stunning model Samantha Jones in this break out thriller for Alan Arkin."
AM1AYVW1H6978_21438,"This is a pretty lame movie.  The only thing kind of fun about it is seeing Renee Zellweger at such a young age, and seeing how much she's changed over the years."
AQYJJT1KAU0XG_19579,Not that interesting. If completely without anything to do one might endure it for the duration. A dog or cat might enjoy it.
A3TI4QL8DJ1G3F_16216,Dated but still very good and very powerful.  We enjoyed it and learned from it.
A17NFLRFTMYXF5_9219,"Dreams of 'lectic sheep
Taunt androids in Scott's future
Ford -- you just can't tell"
A19IA5TGSKNGK3_1656,I finally got this movie on DVD after many years of neglecting to buy i9t on DVD. This movie is awesome. Great acting with some humor.
ARXLHOKV7FKU4_1594,"Since Pat Conroy died, I want to read all his novels and see all his films made from his novel."
A3J5WEY9BS9EFA_11563,"sad that he is long gone but most of his movies rocked and this was cool movie, cool movie, what an actor"
A87EE8ATYDNM0_19115,Hard to believe they made movies like this back in the day. For Linda Blair completists.
A1TVB13B840NLB_22382,I CANT GIVE ANY DVD MORE THAN 1 STAR WHEN ITS IN THE SQUARE FORMAT INSTEAD OF WIDESCREEN AND GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT TYPE OF SOUND IT HAS BECAUSE THERE IS NO MENTION OF IT.  WHAT A CROC !!!!!!
A3CNT2OYO63E3N_7888,"A film that I have enjoyed multiple times.  I like the light-heartedness of this film.

If you have any romanticism in yourself, this will help you to bring it forth."
A1J03J0HZ7KU5T_23626,"""Death Wish 2"" (1982) is an inept piece of filmmaking. This contrived sequel looks as though it was photographed, edited and scored by pornographers. Charles Bronson has a few memorable one-liners, but that's about it. Strictly amateur night."
A25B3JOTYPRCX2_16562,My kids really enjoyed the movie and the history. The graphic design maybe was not the greatest however the story was entertaining and keep them interested. I recommend it
A1VZ0SF3WGAHIY_12885,"Very good sequel which has many laughs. I was an extra in the movie, the dipstick patient so I am biased. My kind of humor. I have seen this many times and it is still funny for me."
A8J8IBIAGVU9E_2950,"This was a gift to my son, he was thoroughly excited about it, he said he loved it."
A1IL9EYL8SKSPT_759,"As a child of the 60s I suppose it's something I have to watch. And it delivers, although the ending is not worthy of the movie."
A38Z5O4NC3TY68_16297,if you are a Mr. Moto fan...you will enjoy this movie.  I hope Amazon makes more available for Prime viewers.  I love the old mysteries.
A1B04MLSX8DDPX_10110,"Spend a little time on you-tube, find old series, test drive - like it / yes / no - then go to Amazon to find set,
on time, as described, good image (black and white), plays well , good stories"
A55DWAFXRTZXG_16343,It look like a good movie. But hoo can see it . I hope if you have other tape to sell. Well pore them. ART
AIN84UNXQUFLK_15296,"I'm a Michael Keaton fan ... Mr. Mom being my favorite. Here, he runs a prostitution ring in a morgue with some hilarious situations."
A65GUVCKEE1OQ_16866,Just arrived and watched a couple shows already. This is a great series and am happy with the disk set. Actually arrived early.
A3PHK2TCCQUZA9_16327,My kids love Godzilla movies.  This one tried to hard to be a real movie. In the 1950 ' s that was probably a good thing. Today it equals Boring.
A2M7BMDU8BPXYN_5221,THIS MOVIE DESERVES THE BEST TREATMENT! IT'S A CLASSIC! PLEASE RELEASE A WIDESCREEN CLEANED UP VERSION OF THIS MOVIE! I WILL NOT PURCHASE A DVD OF THIS UNTIL THEN.
A3HWGTXNO2O86J_6220,"This is s classic romantic comedy-drama, with great dialog and acting by an ensemble cast.  By that I mean Hugh Grant's bizarre ""friends"" contribute greatly to the success and fun of this film."
A2P8KWORWYXAK7_10247,Fun movie but not an award winner in this genre by any means.  Worth the watch.
A1PJ4J7GT1S922_18929,"Typical Bond movie;  action, girls, and I guess another movie that was good when it first came out."
A1TO73YGBQI22N_10729,"Sadly they didn't allow the original screen adaption to stand on its own,  but diluted it with excessive rewrites and fx overdrive.  Not as good as the original release."
A3T11TPKHWDAM9_5233,I own this movie for my dad we both love this movie just wish it was in Blu-ray too
A3RXUJEXGQAY01_8135,"What can I say?! I LOVE THSI  MOVIE!

I'm crazy fan of stitch and I had to have this movie in my movie collection!"
AZQJGDWARL3RR_13701,"This movie is definitely a product of its time with the fashion and hairstyles. The dancing and music however is timeless. Can't say much for the dialogue, very sophomoric and lame."
A1CJ6H6DX29CYJ_20164,The acting is good but with the all Star cast I was disappointed at the direction of the movie.  There are a lot of subtitles and I hate subtitles.
A3DMRDLKIYZZQ_12587,Worst movie ever.  I can't believe it!  This is time I can never get back.
A3BYH766PIVYQN_9509,Really good old school work here by Martin Sheen. You have to understand the context of the times and location too appreciate this...
AO183BO716QPM_1658,I see a lot of negative reviews due to inaccuracy. Sometimes that's not that important. We watch movies for entertainment.
A2DDTUI89WU46R_3172,"Great old movie! Not up to the same standard as Hitchcock's other films, but it was still good. Great to see them as a pair"
A84DE8IMXPBIO_4616,i gave it a 10 its a good move and  wan i go it it was in good shape i am very happy
A3ESBOJZO2LND5_23772,"Terrible ghosting/crosstalk issues--the worst that I've seen on any 3D Blu-ray release. I realize the film is 60 years old, but that shouldn't have anything to do with it. Even the 2D version has it! Very disappointing."
AQIC5TTPYE1GU_14732,"As a teen of the '80's, this is basically essential viewing. Good ""underdog"" story with humor and warmth to boot. James Spader is excellent as the nemesis."
A13KSREATWADOY_8764,You've got to see it.  The lovely remake with a bit of a twist on Shirley Temple's movie.  This is just a great family movie.
A3HBFR2WS99QRR_4014,"VHS, OR DVD, or anything it will ever be on in the future-this is a classic and always will be! Christmas without seeing this movie is just not how I want to spend my holiday!"
A2P7AJYPFTPFB_15285,"Did not like the fact that I could not just rent this movie, I had to buy it."
A1Z0FQGEPV017X_7921,This is a great series.  It should have been a multi-year series.  Great writing and acting.  I like Geena Davis.
A2UIC7PEU00WEM_10456,I liked it because of the plot. The acting was somewhat ok. But like always Sidney Poitier stole the show.
A15QA95CCXW0KV_3479,I really like this movie it was action packed and characters were played well .
A26HD3S38PLD5A_21844,"There are certain guaranteed signals that a movie sucks. Look for these words and/or phrases  THE RETURN OF....
  BACK TO....
  NOW HE IS ALL GROWN UP
  GEORGE CLOONEY
  RETURN TO
  COSTARRING BEN AFFLEK"
A1UCSWDY9MRISV_16874,"Packaging is good, each disc has a holder.  I didn't see the show when it was broadcast, not much action, so I guess whatever I watched I liked better.  It was on sale so it was worth watching."
A2XSSBQPK11HF7_22586,"Not exactly David Spade's best work, but absolutely in keeping with what we should expect of Chris Farley. Lowbrow, crude, childish, immature. To find this funny is to admit that one's sense of humor quit developing in 5th grade."
A2JSZ6OR4MRXD9_4284,very good movie with John Wayne about ww2 and the taking of that island from the Japanese and showing the seven guys planting our flag
A4J68LHP32KSV_22463,The sex scene at the end was in poor taste. The action and plot were clich?.
A2DYS4DQVGV6HD_11317,I can't really rate it as I bought it as a gift. It looks as if it will be good.
A12P88IYXI7PET_10463,A dangerous lifestyle for teens who needed real adult supervision. this movie only reminded me of what happens when children are allowed to run their own lives (disastrous).
A2G71M4HFFPJJN_10242,"Scary and creepy, just the way I like my horror movies! And I really like Lance Henriksen. :)"
A3MP8YCQR1E4TP_4707,This is a good movie with some action & drama through out.  Movies are a hobby for me.  I like a variety of genres.
AE8WGKCWO9XYX_23424,"on a scale of a million to juan 10, that movie i am not happy to put only spanish where is english and CC"
A2H4ZVN88CTHH2_11147,"The acting is horrible, but it's still a cool old flick, worth a beer and a bowl of popcorn...maybe on a crisp fall night..."
A1WWVWVTFUBR7N_6685,"This is a very good dvd disc set. The movie's play excellent and if you like classic horror, as I do, it is great."
AERD0XWMBC85L_15218,The last gasp effort of the Wehrmacht is brought out in this film.  As well as the complacency of the US forces who thought the war was already over and were totally surprised.  Entertaining film for WWII buffs
A34H7116KZNV9V_15867,Cheesy horror at its finest. Not really as good as the original but just as bizarre and fun to watch.
A4CQ3DS64W0IB_13619,I remember this being really popular years ago but I had never seen it. I fast forwarded through most of it& can't think of why it was so popular
A2JXHZGJGT9TUG_14404,movie has lots of subtitles which I don't mind but if you happen to look away you miss a lot.  Factual movie but it can be boring if your really want  a movie that is more entertaining
A2Z9XBCYT3AHHU_5179,"what a wonderful film. if only i could have had a father like that when i was a kid....boy what could have been of me? oh well, that's life. a wonderful film though."
A1VYWOLFR6Q8EK_1963,We thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this movie.  Music and all it was a good evening's entertainment.
AMRM550MOW37G_2391,"Just when I started to think this was a predictable movie, the plot thickened. Won't give you any other clues that might be spoiler alerts."
AYVJ8QOHILYKF_14861,"It's mostly worth viewing to watch the young Dustin Hoffman do his stuff. A suspenseful gripper of a story, well done. Not particularly for the faint-hearted, though. If it's after ten and you're alone, lock your doors."
ASSOCRBJ21S8W_9746,Good movie and story line.  One of John Wayne's better movies and with a good lineup of big names.
A1XFMKIVQ6F8AH_23432,If you enjoy English period dramas this one is very good.  In the same vein as others of this time period.
A1DO9YUO966WMJ_23995,"This is my favorite Little Princess version, the actors do an amazing job. Unfortunately, the DVD's conversion is very dark and lacks clarity. It's the only affordable disc available however."
A1E2G7QGYYI01A_15825,The movie was an old favorite of mine that I wanted for my library. Quality was very good and delivery fast.
AHH71RCFRXFRZ_22718,"the instant streaming 'froze' several times...otherwise the clarity was good.  Seen the film many times before over the years, but the 'freezing' was a negative."
AWBXDSNVRS7C0_21034,Never cared for rubber monster movies. This one made me appreciate the original Godzilla. OK if you have a taste for it.
A1M5QXZZFND5WU_9491,"Troy Donahue and Sandra Dee couldn't have looked better.  As far as the storyline of this movie, almost laughingly moralistic when compared to our new millennium.  Worth buying for the scenery and great acting though."
A2W1M32DLB3N7U_23552,"Even for this venue, this is about the worst one yet. I never take it seriously, but come on, this was a beast!  Won't be watching any more of these in a good-looking time, if ever"
A2AUKCM1DZ43HU_20550,New DVD by Disney has new voices and wording for the characters.  We were used to the older voices and the colloquial wording.  Sad to see the change.
A2OEP4HB1CKIJO_16319,Must be a prequal as Godzilla is called Gigantis in this movie and they tried (unsuccessfully) to wrap a human interest story around the monster fighting.  Far from my favorite Godzilla movie.
A1BB7TD2AROT86_992,This is an excellent collector's edition. I can't believe that 30 years passed since this movie was released. Steven Spieberg and the movie really deserve this kind of edition. The package arrived perfectly.
A201ME99SRHE2J_20938,"Good movie. The story is entertaining and engaging for many age groups. A bit too scary for young children maybe, but a good story with many lessons to be learned for sure."
A36M2UGDTQRD4J_22294,"I expected to find it a bit more like a Peter Sellers Comedy, but ....
For all the hype I read and reviews I saw, I was actually disappointed.
then again maybe I was just having an off day."
A28ZOKMGSS3HI_21995,"Credulity, thy name is Moyers.
Interesting only if you enjoy hours of somebody speaking without anything to say.  Tedium at its finest."
A1WBKV2G2JW27A_18747,"It's ok, but not as good as the original Inger Nilsson film series from the 60s-70s.  Even with the dubbing."
A2D582F1IQWR21_6907,"Excellent mix of gore, thriller and sexuality... Good story, complex, disturbing. Christian Bale brilliant as Patrick Bateman one of the greatest, and handsome, psychopath on movies."
A3GXDSPW5M3M6V_21336,"Okay, so it won an Oscar... in the 30s. I didn't really care for it. Grant has much more interesting fare both black and white and color."
A14CJR4X9I1EOY_8672,"Jodie Foster did her usual very good acting job.  She sold the story and her beliefs in ""life out there"".
Photography was good."
A1ZWZJV1HG5FXK_18899,Was a little too scary for grandson..........so did not finish.  Would depend on each families decision making for kids to watch.
A5758KLH61UFO_21019,"Grainy HD video quality.  Kiddie story-line.  Again, streaming difficulties watching HD movies due to constant buffering.  Amazon needs to address this issue."
A3SORJTNKR1M0P_1489,The original and the best. All the sequels they've made cant compare to the first one. I never get tired of watching this.
A1N7Z6RBVRNIWL_2661,Basically just got this to make my own Blu-Ray/DVD combo of this movie & got it for a good reasonable price.
A3R581WU0C9AL4_929,"Good movie for the 1970""s I always wanted to see this movie. after visiting Devils Tower in WY this summer I decided to watch it.
Thanks for having it available Amazon"
A329TTW9VJ2NBU_1349,"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent.  Great movie, even better DVD. Great features.  The best documentary I have ever seen."
A2GU8NOZNB2TYN_18468,It's the Godfather Part III. Weakest in series. See it once so you'll know it's weak.
AWK0BPMWTT67Q_11063,"Still a solid show, the plots are getting a little thin with some very familiar story lines, but it still holds up, overall. Interesting season ending, but more excitement is to come."
A3L3B81RJIDO56_19829,"I have to admit, the best part of this Movie are the Busty Women.  It has a good story line, and the Actors are a little cheesy but it has it's moments.  Guys you will like the Sexy Women!!!  ALC"
A1BN3HHI0RDVBE_20462,The puppetry was amazing. It's just too bad the movie folks didn't spend as much time on the plot and writing.
A17FOO11117ZTG_21585,"While I usually enjoy anything these two guys did independently, this film was a total dud."
ABV16WJAFJKRB_5609,This was purchased as a gift for my son who owns a martial arts studio and I've no idea  what he thinks of it as a movie.
ACWIC6O5LOQ4J_5052,"Atticus is a man.  He does not pretend to be a man, he walks a hardline.  A line that needs to be followed more often."
A1FZDRHPU6D97Y_19026,Don't buy waste of money bad picture looks like the DVD no remastering done what so ever save you money other than that great film very very funny
A2ZVJ63VUZ7NMY_19392,"East Of Eden, Rebel W/O A Cause, & Cat On A Hot Tin Roof weren't on these DVDS.  I was utterly disappointed.  The movies are excellent, they just weren't in this set.  This isn't the 1st time this has happened."
A3EVTMHL9S7SII_5525,"The Breakfast Club is on my list of the top 10 movies of all time. Perhaps everyone won't feel this way, but for me, I could watch this movie every day and still love it."
ASH3M4K3BQKZ7_23839,"This movie was so boring, I can't find the words to describe. I will say this...it should be called accident Spa and not death spa, as people only get hurt. Lame!"
A1BV7JS2VQUANN_16468,Bought this for my brother as he's a fan of the series.  He loves it!
A33F8ZLBK7WWD9_3061,"Fallen is smart, exciting, and genuinely frightening. Denzel Washington and John Goodman give stellar performances in this creepy flick. The film is NOT predictable and stands as one of the best most intelligent horror  films of the 90s."
A2ZKWQIUE2WADB_17481,"The Movie is  GREAT but, I can't play it on my DVD player! I did not see a warning about the type of DVD player. Not happy and don't understand what the difference is."
A2MQHXIHBCKOQP_20133,"I like the movie, that why I bought a copy - but beware. There is no copy right on it so you can buy a rotten copy like I did. I ended u[ throwing it way it was so poor."
A27GPJT0W01AW8_22235,"Just an expensive, pointless film.  There were cameos by just about everyone who acts in comedy.  I guess that was to let you know that the film was a comedy, because it was not particularly funny either."
A2ZA9XBHQHDZBG_20480,This is NOT the original totoro I'm so sad I missed that. Its stupid. The dialog is all different and terrible
A3MHNBAOJBPQK7_4101,Got this as a Christmas gift for husband.  Guess who is watching it?  Me while working out. Most of this history happened when I was a growing up so learning new stuff and quite entertaining.
A3QDX8RSDPN63X_8993,"The movie is a great classic.  This version however, lacks all of Deckard's monologs, e.g. ""I don't know why he let me live ...""  I was rather shocked to realize this - it's just not the same movie."
ADIC3G6FM7RQA_22882,World War II propaganda movie. Good for rainy day or when there is nothing on TV but  reality TV programs about dysfunctional people.
A3B9IKUWO3SHCE_20809,classic story but one must take into account that it is in black and white and rather dated. great cast of characters.
A13JU88JAHN72I_6432,"I never grow tired of watching this movie,.. the rich stories of each woman... blending their pasts with present day... somehow it makes you feel better about your own two feet... 5 stars!"
A3TOVM0W2JTIUP_8211,Most amazing show ever. I am still quite a huge fan and love owning all of the series.
A2C8B5QS3DQN2F_2584,Great cast...lovely photography but the story itself is depressing.  It moves quite slowly and I did not care for the narration.
A2JL9CQ1WS2H4R_9307,Typical hollywood excrement masquerading as entertainment.  Mostly it's shot in the dark.  Mostly the audio is inaudible.  There is no plot.  It's a series of scenes put together by a child.  Treats the viewer as an idiot.
A1CLRMKWODHFOP_17003,"Watching this movie gave me a feeling of nostalgia, remembering when there were actually some good cops.  Seems silly to even think about it these days.  Apart from that, the movie was just plain dumb.  Jackboots on steroids."
A2PDJ2HW1POY3N_11338,"What an amazing adventure, captured on film!  I had no idea that this footage existed - so glad we discovered it!"
A2AZ2U9KAEHZ2Z_7388,A great old movie I had not seen it since it was released really enjoyed it
A3B2WSZZXJCQJ9_10572,"Anthony Hopkins is mind blowing in this movie, the suspense almost kills you, you just don't want to blink. Awesome movie."
A2DDQKF5WAV9UK_5307,Arrived timely and well packaged. As far as the media? Good quality and it's John Wayne!
AJTYT3E0J93Q6_5395,A wonderful way to introduce children to the life of Moses.  This beautiful story is filled with amazing music.  My seven-year-old son couldn't believe this was a true story.
AI5ZTUO61FFHV_9965,"The story holds your interest and you have no idea how it will end till it does unlike many other domes day movies.
the movies has many stores in one each believable with well known and good acting"
A2ZPY6PG49XBVV_5014,"The background of the front cover is a little dark. It's hard to make out the pictures on it. However, overall this is a very nice DVD."
AZFIDM38RSZ8Y_16977,"A strange movie, but if you're a Sean Connery fan it might be worth watching."
A175568XQZJQ63_4068,"Wow, I was captured from the beginning. Amazing performances! Renews the concept of possibilities in every life."
AWCX1MPM94R1A_1815,A beautiful told story set in the country/city of Helena MT. A real life story of Mr. McClane. A movie that fishermen and non fishermen alike will enjoy.
A32ZIRX9BR6462_23665,"This is definitely a classic and well produced.  I don't find that it has a lot of family value, however, it isn't a bad movie either.  It's probably a one-time watch movie for me though...."
AJSXRK0JK6597_14176,"Jackie Chan has a cameo role.
print is poor and the dubbing awful. The DVD however contains good add on features like a trivia game and a DVD dictionary giving details on dvd features, etc.
good buy only for the dictionary."
A2WM0PZF0B9G20_4228,"My daughters favorite. She had VHS and played it some much it wore out, This was a replacement"
A2QRSXK9CVQFC5_5962,Funny as hell. Some parts are absurd and a little long but I would say the flying bat and hitchhiker scenes MORE than make up for it.
A262AEAYVUFS3U_19260,Not bad .... I only watched because I read the book a long time ago in school very  slow movie
A1E9R06OUKT7Q4_20964,from prepublicity people thought this was going to be a remaster. turned out to just be same transfer with new extras.  highly recommend this movie in any format
A2AT3GFVBECPNB_18065,While the acting wasn't bad for it's day the movie it self less than steller..... you can spend your time and money on better.
A3EHWUSR1HN6BC_4205,"The production was great.  Liked the sounds and effects.  This movie is a stark reminder of ""what goes around, comes around.""  No matter what we do- good or bad."
A35GNQK1DC7WXU_11289,This is not the same story of the classic original Planet of the apes....Very good story with great visual effects!!!
A16MELC0WCMA05_16952,"Movie is badly acted, poorly written, and looks like it was filmed on a back lot.  Such a disappointment compared to the first one."
A3CN2KXSYK5HSX_15264,"This is a DVD-R.  I own the laserdisc copy of this video and it blows away this ""DVD"" in quality."
AA72EBZMRGTL3_14744,This one is great for teens.  I had my granddaughter watch it and she loved it.  Teaches some good lessons for young and old alike.  Wish I could go back to this fun and difficult age.
A2X7OB7TYQC7B7_2430,"Bought this, bought shouldn't have.  Claims to be Sci-Fi.  And maybe it technically is, but the interesting part starts as the credits roll at the end.  Boring movie."
A385TUBQAM6FPE_21048,Getting old I reckon because this kind of movies with kids acting like nuts does not light my candle.  I could not watch all of this movie because it was s booing.
A1BBRNLK60QEQZ_10388,Definitely one movie to have in your collection.  Has the feel of a Disney musical thanks in part to the legendary song writing team of The Sherman Brothers. Unforgettable songs and beautiful imagery carry this film all the way!
ASA4ECJJKPSY2_4106,"Acting by Daniel Day Lewis was good, but I did not enjoy the story line very much-kind of dark subject"
AIPVAK1J3HDQL_2416,"Eh, it was ok. I would give the movie 2.5 if possible. This movie was a slow starter and it never really picked up a pace."
A3KIJ8OUHXKH2A_18838,"It was a good movie for the time period, but a little over rated. It is worth a peek you won't be disappointed."
A3VEECFGJ48PR6_13416,A movie so bad it's laughably good. See Gandalf before he learned to act. Hahahahaha this is why the 80s had to die.
A3JZCYUUISJS1M_22826,There were no English subtitles when I watched it on my Kindle so I can't say whether it's a good movie or not.
A1AICS6EH5R6Q7_17225,"The weak link in an otherwise very enjoyable trilogy. If you're watching the series on Amazon Prime, it's worth seeing for the sake of continuity and to see how very far off 1985's idea of what 2015 would be like."
ATJF5QEVNMWIL_15684,The SitS 50th anniversary edition Blu-ray is a HUGE disappointment! Avoid this release!! The video quality is beyond bad. The gold dvd's picture is sadly far better.
A3UFMOU6C5PHJX_22573,As you follow the clues you do anticipate the ending. We are Tom Selleck fans so we still enjoyed the movie.
A1V0JMSCQHBNYY_23450,Fun movie! Great seeing Hulk Hogan in this roll. Good story and hilarious! Also good plot twist. Ok for kids.
A5NWYXK1GUJVL_2154,Entertaining and well-acted.  This movie is formulaic but very good and well worth the time to watch.
A3R0GAPLY5I6W0_2825,"So cute!  The wit and humor, and the story can't be beat.  These older movies required real acting and you get it in this one!"
A27F0SZMT9YSIP_20052,"Stanwyck parraine Douglas dans ce film trs old-class, plus mlodramatique que noir. Pas trs original, mais les acteurs sont convaincants. Pourquoi s'en priver?"
A3AIT2IO5NEPZC_4252,Ron Eldard did a superb job of acting. A very realistic movie with a great story line. Great movie
A21PPESP3TDNKB_18076,brand new. given as a gift. doesn't play (found out too late for refund) !
AEWAQ2Z2U4MG1_23286,"Entertaining, but a little disjointed due to time elapsed between episodes. Only 6 episodes. Mira Sorvino plays Conchita, perhaps a break out role?"
AGNLZRSMX0PEC_12088,"I have the later version, but I still like this. Three stars for nostalgia. My only gripe is the picture quality is not the best."
A2BROTSVAZX3SK_18752,"All of the contrived Bond movie formula sequences that accompanied all the wannabe Bond movies but worse ( there are only 2 legitimate Bonds, Connery and Craig)"
A3PNR8PMRT6NU4_18154,What was it about?  Never could figure it out.  Love Sean C. but not in this movie.  It was a waste of his acting abilities.
A3DH16S0PWV7YL_23936,Horrible movie. My husband and I thought it was going to be at least a little scary and we were laughing about it.
A1WJ7NAZLH1X8Q_861,"About the 10th time my wife and I have seen this since theatrical release. It's a wonderful feel good movie with a sad ending sort of like ""Bambi"" and ""Old Yeller."""
A144W50UYZG4YX_16188,"This movie is plain bloody hopeless! The movie doesn't even have a bloody storyline! This movie is just too bloody violent! So i would bloody well not recommend this to anyone!
P.S Sorry about the language"
A1MJIUA9AFSN4C_23529,"I cannot believe that this work was so well received and reviewed. It felt dated,  without meaning and alas also without diversion.  Such a waste of talent."
A1JFNZ4UAMEZN3_4550,I really enjoyed seeing these three main characters (men) dress and perform as female impersonators throughout the movie/musical.  The acting was not all that great but I still watch it from time to time.
A17UJP1K6IZKXK_6585,"Yes it is a shame its not wide screen , but the DVD contains the original trailer which the blu-ray does not."
ASGR853HDOHGJ_23368,"I enjoyed this movie until the scenario got too big to fit into a single movie, then things started to get a bit too much."
A3BJGCJRYQOUI2_23252,The W.C. Fields sequence is completely missing from the DVD. 20th Century Fox should offer replacements. This is inexcusable!! Very disappointed
AYYOPF6RG019D_16670,Lightning only struck once for 'Fletch'.  Nothing could top the original anyway.  True 'Fletch' fans already know this--
ASDA50O3BE3L8_11845,the story is ok; but the quality of this film is not very good.. would not recommend anyone to purchase it.
A1I2479E5WINN_5704,Literally just watched this last night. The scene where they are all in the library talking about their lives.. classic. This is a great movie and really has stood the test of time.
A2316EWUBDVNSC_20896,"Great story for kids 7-14, acting a bit weak, effects low budget, story formulaic, but with a nice twist."
A3KK625F8JFB22_5161,"Still love it after all these years! One of Steve Martin's best. Watched it with my 18 yr. old daughter. She laughed, too."
A2JZRRBOV7QOUQ_9828,"According to technical details posted, the regular VHS runtime is 194 minutes, while the unrated DVD is 174.. I hope unrated means more time not less (?!)"
A3RSIK5G8DPELD_9514,I just couldn't appreciate the characters. Fine actors playing jerks. Nice cinematography. Natural Born Killers was much more fun. Worth a watch but this disk will go into the give away pile.
A2TZBG6KSJYWAM_17765,"I never expect much from Bo Derek, other than the all too obvious in the film, but to see Richard Harris wallow in this muck was too much."
A2B9W1KRWF3NAP_18022,I gave us 30 minutes into the movie.  The plot was non-existent and the acting not as good as a high school production.
A22JYJRVBHK4OF_2127,I love this musical!  So happy to have it on DVD!  Rich in color and clarity.
A2PF0G45I2OH5O_11384,"CRACKED ... I received a damaged disc . Bad product .
Was really looking forward to watching it ..."
A33606ENKITHQI_10472,I never had heard of this movie and was pleasantly surprised. Lots of car chases and blow 'me up effects. I thought it was a good movie to watch after trying to find something I have not seen.
A2CL818RN52NWN_2876,"THIS MOVIE IS A REAL SLEEPER.IT IS SOMEWHAT DEPRESSING. I WOULD CALL THIS A CHIC FLICK BUT I LIKED IT TOO HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.RENT OR BUY,YOU WONT BE SORRY."
A3OOQMPQSKHEI4_14585,"Enjoyable film with Monroe at her acting best.  I prefer her in more glamorous roles, but appreciate her venture into other areas."
A24MW3TBPWZL3N_5657,"this movie is so crazy its great, you've got great actors, Japanese, American and British (the German guy) , maybe it wasn't as nuts as this in 1941,  but i have always loved this movie."
AX1ERS194HOHL_14812,"Special effects and plot twists a bit cheesy at times. OK to kill an evening, but there are definitely better disaster movies out there."
ADKNIULLR0Q7G_2426,It's a comparatively old movie. But the main discussion topic is always worth revisit: genetically superiors.
AMHLRPLTM9ICP_4447,"Three Hollywood studs, in drag !!
Funny as hell, and they carry it off so well !!
Miss Veta, Nozema & Che Che
gut stuck in southern hell,
and make the best of it !!

MUST SEE MOVIE !!!"
A3O1U241CMHGH6_4018,"If you like Christmas movies and haven't seen this one, you are missing out.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!"
A2DVLOW84FJBRL_6559,"If you're looking for any humor or anything uplifting, look elsewhere. This is a very dark and depressing movie but it keeps the viewer's attention!"
A3LUJ8N9XO3O4E_16095,"I can't help but like this movie. Yes, it's corny but I like the humor and that Lucy is so accident prone. I enjoy the mischief she gets into throughout."
A2MKOFBEJAJ4ER_9357,"Seller seemed annoyed at my questions and referred back to the original statements to make her point.
Not user friendly but DVD was as stated."
A3QRYJN05B1Y57_20049,Not much too say except for the movie was okay.  Not a fan of Victor Mature anyway.
A33GDICI8Y91P0_7031,Perfect just as described I don't know what else to say but thanks I couldn't be more happy thanks a lot
A3KJBPJ0T0MNPS_14623,This is a good movie that had a lot surprises around every corner. I am happy I added it to my collection
A2CDM084DH8GXP_8529,"I like it when a movie is a little bit more true to the book, as unrealistic as that may be."
A3FREW57175PQJ_8577,"Really no plot line to it other than the sad story of Brad Pitt's vampire.  A lot of blood, gore, and naked women."
ALSCXARLASS9V_3858,This movie is a classic--that's why I ordered it for our family DVD collection. Great story that should be watched year after year at Christmas time.
A2P2EJ6SG8PAK8_18404,"So great one liners in this movie, but not as good as I had remembered.  Sometimes you should just let the memory roll on."
A1NCCOWNCDPEQ9_12680,"Very poor plot, the acting was sub standard and in some places a little hokey. Not worth ones time."
A1FCZNWXMB786V_16965,Ok movie. Plot could be better.  Acting was good. Special effects were ok for the time period it was made.
A2JX9AMQV8BYK_16352,Saw it as a kid and decided that I'd like to add it to my collection.  Nothing mysterious about the plot.
A31MLYOLILAC5B_6096,Alright! Alright! Alright! This was my High school class and I knew several people like the characters in the film.
A2PL5TVNOIQE1W_849,The acting done by all cast members is wonderful and this is one of my all time favorite films & always will be.
A3DYHILYT2VP22_23965,"Star TREK! Hello? Not star sitting on a space station!. Roddenberry would have never green lit this mess. Needs two more words? U mm how about ""oh no!"" for the censors"
A3MQ653OI8VLHO_8179,A classic forever.  My daughter loves all the Cinderella movies.  She watches them over and over again.
A2A0XJ3X2TNIGF_9132,"If you like special effects and panning shots, enjoy.  If you like a good story to drive it all, I would avoid Blade Runner.  The novel that inspired the film is worth reading, but I would not watch this again."
A20HM0K71KQ5M6_21284,"Cheap jokes, adolescent humor, a walking fart machine....it doesn't get much better.  Great ending.  Giggity, giggity, indeed.  They want 3 more words but this about sums it up:  You will not be disappointed"
A3RK1Y6G71Q4N8_10301,An absolute favorite of mine from a great novel by the uber talented James Herbert.
A34U2D7T6WYW0P_13042,One of the original 80's slasher flicks.  Better than anything new today.  It's easy to predict who is going to die.  Check it out for some good old nostalgia.
A2JT3HOTYUDO88_12024,A different kind of action movie with a love drama and the story line is not that predictable. A Korean production is well worth watching!
AWF2S3UNW9UA0_17349,I wouldn't recommend it. I say saw it when young liked the romance and history to it.w and liked as a ch
A1C96JTJ3U8FAH_4511,I absolutely love this movie.  Patrick Swayzy in heels!!  Wesley Snipes in a dress!!  John Leguizano in a mini skirt!!
A332OQ8I24CBQI_18806,"Still entertaining, but wish they would have played the original theme since that's what I kept singing to my kids before the movie played."
ASB3B2APNPQDB_2519,A lot of action. This movie kicks butt. Roy is great here. And I am not a fan of helicopters. There is something satisfying in seeing this movie. Maybe the satisfaction of seeing McDowell... Best say no more
A3B9XTIDLP6BKN_14547,"A former Viet Nam POW conspires with terrorists to crash a Goodyear blimp into the Super Bowl. Sky high adventures, a surprising amount of shooting."
A1FLC7E3UD2368_12190,"Not scary enough, exciting enough,...but it got the job done. Heroes come in different forms. Good always will beat evil."
A3CA2NQOM07KEF_12155,"This must have been so frustrating for Maximilian Schell, but it is a fascinating documentary anyway."
A1RI8DHBPU0GYA_14743,"This is a real classic and one of my favorite movies.

A little childish and even silly"
A2PAWMGNOAULRU_5027,One of the best movies ever done with one of the best actors ever to act. It is discouraging to see how far Hollywood has fallen from such a pinnacle of fine drama as this movie represents.
A200D8BOPMR35S_19827,It was an original way to combine a number of over-used movie themes and make fun of them all in 1 movie
A2V4JTT9869R9R_1061,"Good story, very current. I hope writers keep writing interesting stories like this. Enjoyed the ending, very positive, loved it."
AOG975LXYLX3D_18587,Ok McCoy Doctor Who episode which tells of the story of various unival evil characters and the role the Doctor played.
A3CNI9ZHUI9YYG_12545,This is a classic must-see for fans of old westerns.  Jimmy Stewart is excellent.  Any fan of Blazing Saddles will appreciate seeing where Madeline Kahn got the inspiration for her character.
AVM8U1UF1QZ8X_11866,"An eye opener if you were still in the closet at this time in history. Sad, shocking, humorous at times. Meaningful. Give it a shot."
AH4CT4E2PIAP2_12003,"This is a movie with a good message, but it is so full of foul language that we will not watch it again!"
AUDWW68X0D05A_21140,Whoever came up with the name for this movie was right on.  I became close to brain death by persisting to the end of this movie.
A2P7K1SPPKXPO4_7733,What can one say about this classic....Julia Roberts will always be Pretty Woman.  Thank goodness!
A21XW0T5J0DJN9_2203,"Enjoyed this.  Like the title says and during these times it was ""Hard Times.  Many people made a living as best they could."
AZJRZOV6S0KVD_22815,"Like all those Westerns we used to watch and love when we were kids. Trouble is, that rules many of us out."
A1ZMF0VD4OCJ8I_1140,It was funny and thought provoking  Acting was ok the stunts were good It was good to see Arnold in a different kind of role
ATOUXR3SKN2FZ_23606,we love British movies but not this one unless you want to spend an evening bored to death than it is for you
A34JI9GIAY1RW3_19908,NOT THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES I KNOW. Didn't watch all of it. Never did the original Beverly hillbillies do what this people did in this movie. Some People may like it.
AVUXRVOONT6ZW_4678,this is a good movie I saw this movie 2 times at the drive in when I was living in CA. I am glad that I found this movie on DVD this movie holds a lot of memories for me.
A1FXZ7D3Y1YY2L_22505,I hate the 1st season but you got to have it to complete the set.
A1A70N8S4PV1RF_23858,"So many F-bombs we stopped watching.  Not much comedy, some nudity, lots of F-bombs and hardly worth looking."
A3Q8V6U8FVUEDQ_16812,"What is it? The beginning and progress was fine but what the end ?
Just Get Out Of Here, A work uncompleted !!!"
AVMJ2BIDJELNP_11904,Great show.  Some of the subtitles were missing though.  There were a few lines missing here and there in about 4 episodes.
A14TE5UGFDZK48_13310,"weird story line, but kind of what you would expect from the person who created Miami Vice. A cultish classic."
A2JD9YDHLC76IB_20890,"crap.
what happens when adults forget that the only difference between children and adults is experience.

Children are not stupid and this was clearly made for stupid people, or possibly infants that don't have the motor skills to reject it.,"
A2MLC8U8LI23PI_2458,A classic movie. Entrance Hawke and Uma Thurman are stunning. Even if you don't like Sci Fi this is a good watch!
A1AQP0G52WQWFS_1879,Excellent story set in a better time in America. The river still runs over the same rocks and will for many millennia. How we live our lives and the choices we make are the variables we often see too late.
A3IZDNJ7GLXU1I_22564,Product was not as the picture stated very disappointed will be returning for a full refund
A2HFUTS4EY4WNW_8996,"Great to look at but the sounds drops out every few seconds making this stream almost unwatchable.
It's like Amazon's stream of this movie, which I paid $12.99 for, has the hiccups. Beware....."
AEZTBGFFJ9EU2_14252,One of my favorite 80s movies. Watched again with my daughter -- she also enjoyed it.
A246DKCLS8HEC7_20147,This was a very low budget film which only adventure science enthusiasts would enjoy watching. It is not recommended for the average viewer.
AE9NP2WIYTMI9_11552,GOOD MOVIE RELATING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE A FEAR OF FLYING AND/OR A FEAR OF HIEGHTS.  MIX IN AN ATTEMPTED HIGH-JACKING AND MAKES FOR A GOOD MOVIE.  JM
A10WJV7C3EBXL0_1387,I always Cry when Heroine Bob dies! I love this movie! Has a great and attractive cast! I wish they would make A second movie
A1BMUQKIE2RF5N_14651,"slow movie, too hard to follow. A little childishly themed - once time viewing was enough, I would not own it"
A12Y2KYDLUNYSY_11519,"A bad movie.. Didn't like it

Its not worth it at all. A disappointment.

Will not recommend people to buy."
A11D7CWIQKUA19_14545,"But a little on the cheesy side, doesn't really convey like reality. While your watching you are aware that it's just entertainment instead of absorbed in the moment."
A3B0P37JWHUSUG_5460,I thought the movie was okay I did like it but there was a part in the movie that really bothered me that I wish could of been different but besides that I thought it was an okay movie
A3SH4KS7QRYIQI_13962,"A timely classic done in fun way. Showed the ""genteel white slavery in the old south"". Had watched this movie years ago but did not regret watching it again."
A1V0SEW07QEJAO_19746,"It's Pauly Shore, so the expectations really shouldn't be very high to begin with.  Decent mindless entertainment."
A2KTCWDHTZ2IRI_23354,"The cd goes in my DVD player and says wrong region, do I have the right money to send it back?"
A2EX1F7DFNK6G_10043,"Just a good movie, nothing fantastic or awe inspiring just a good story with adequate performances.  You don't see too many adequate performances in movies anymore or on TV."
A1ABU8BNR8ZH4B_9687,I like the movie Titanic.  This is a video of the movie.  I like it.
AJWEHPJZJQCFV_21657,Not my cup of tea and found it to be not interesting within the first 5 minutes.
AUFPSBARLMR7I_10745,"You would have to be a moron to like this movie.

Stupid plot. Bad acting. no redeeming scenes at all!"
A3V82CSUHLC627_2623,This movie dragged a little in content. I love Sally Fields but it wasn't my favorite movie of hers. The acting was good. The movies plot not so much.
A33GIZIIQ9Z9WJ_22074,"Low budget, crappy movie with ""pocket change"" budget.
Paul Walker, shame on you. What is your excuse to play in this crappy movie? Gotta pay your bills? WTF, man? Where is your pride for what you do?

Complete disappointment. Boooooooooo!"
A2WXEIMS9ERFJE_10525,I found that this movie seemed to be forced in many areas of the movie.  Actor roles were not up to par.
AGMLLSL26JB5C_9626,"It was a gift for someone and I hope they like It every much.
which gave to them as a secret  sanat?"
A1I0POKBMICMQM_17874,Very strange.  I like the music better than the movie.  I think the artist was on acid while listening to the music to get that interpretation of the songs.
A14JKRCGSG1XYV_5913,This movie is a summertime tradition for us. We watch it every year when it gets hot. All the snow and ice help break up the focus on the hear.
A2WX459OYASGZ0_19741,I didn't enjoy this as much as I thought I would.  I read the synopsis of the story and that's why I ordered it.  It's just not that funny of a movie.
A1FSOQ9SPVOK8S_14110,I don't really know what to say about Houseboat except it is a fun to watch love story with good acting.
AFEZZWNH0IWKV_2586,Love this movie. Have seen it 3 times and now can see even more. I never get tired of it.
A3QY0GOCOZL37P_13910,Typical John Wayne... Awesome animal shots! The safari feel was a different angle. A true classic that can be watched again.
A23TZA1A9QKW5R_2707,"Lovely illustrations and nicely read.  I enjoyed the animation that added to the story, rather than overwhelmed it.  Fun Storytime presentation!"
A3QSX8JIC3XIR4_8739,"JFK REVIEW

The story was rushed, MUCH LIKE the Kennedy autopsy.
Not believable.
Too many holes in oliver Stone's version."
A1JG5E0N4984ZC_17015,But I can see how it would appeal to some. Another classic that covers adolescent mind thought. Just wasn't for me.
A2CXB895A3UU1U_12037,"Overall, a very well done movie. Story is good and it keeps you guessing ""Who is good and who is bad""? Actually felt very comfortable watching this with my 12 year old daughter."
A2Q1U9NQSPVZHK_16302,LOTS OF FUN... I loved this when I was 8 years old.. Still works for me. I wish the quality could be better. But it was intact and the picture was fine. Lots of fun for the kid in me...
A24VX2MY56W0YG_16259,Not one of the better movies by the Marx brothers.  It was fun to see where Woody Allen got many of his bits from however.
AH6972QIUGL21_6121,"Very good movie with a ton of extra features on the Criterion edition. Buy that one instead, it's worth the extra fifteen bucks!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dazed-and-Confused-The-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B005D0RDVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dazed and Confused (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray</a>]"
A3L1R3UV7G1X06_11109,"wished it could of showed more of where Jesus grew up. also more personal information, that is not already in the Bible. Did enjoy it though."
A3HBMULPLH5CLI_12669,Great story but film was not all that. The film was dark in some scenes and the sound was bad. I think when they converted it to DVD they lost some of original color and sound. Yal was great
AMRRLOM3XFSXX_14409,A young Michael Douglas ina light hearted comedy.  Not all that well done but good for a few laughs
A2PEODRM2OQJ88_13107,"Very funny. One of my favorites of all time.  Some of the dialogue has been changed and a scene or two have been cut from this one, as it was created in a much less ""politically correct"" era."
A2VFIOS5CQD4U7_14318,Great to see great actors when they were young and unpolished.  George C Scott was always good.
ARX8S89SX7FQ9_12059,"Old Sherlock Holmes movie...with name actors, but very low budget.  Ok for nostalgia sake

AVFHUBXRKA59M_4078,I had this in vhs so need to get it in dvd go way to lean  about what it takes to get to the moon and I love ever thing about space
A1ITL5C99D1KK7_8952,Not as good as I thought it would be for a mystery thriller. Plot is convoluted and any twists in the end is bogged down from the convoluted story. 2.5 stars / 5
A1DT0M5HF1ZV4M_10876,"This movie just moves too slowly.  I got about half way through & turned it off.
Good idea, but I just couldn't sit through it."
A36ESXJM2QJ0JG_21487,"Enjoyable,  thought provoking and intriguing.  You find yourself drawn to these characters.  Difficult to follow at times had to rewatch a few sections to pick up the story.  Highly recommend"
A3CFY5835FLEOI_1566,"Loved this flick as Steve Martin does a great job with his character.  Highly recommended and very funny.  If you get a chance, check it out!."
A377F7RMYZY8IE_11697,"A family fun program with NO FILTH.
These are becoming more and more rare.

Watch it together as a family.  Make sure the kids know it's FANTASY."
A139F75WM7CXPI_9375,"Slow, passionless, pointless production of a complicated masterpiece.  No fire. No passion. Boring.  and even worse: trying watching it without knowing who it is or what it is about!!  Clueless."
A9N6OLBXI52X6_6262,"So charming...completely unbelievable of course, but oh so charming. My recommendation is to buy it and see."
ARKZ0LC797F9I_21197,"The movie was Decent, but not overly romantic. Not a fun movie, it was more poignant and reflective. Watch it and see."
A2V964D025M425_1199,Such a good movie - oldie but a goodie.  I used to watch it all the time as a kid so watching it as an adult is a bit of a head trip.
A2XPNVETZP4TG5_8300,"This product was like it was advertised, I felt it was reasonably priced and arrived promptly & in good condition."
A7NG1G3X9DLRQ_15512,"I have to say the remake is better.
I saw this years ago and forgot all about it.
Not a good movie at all.
Sad the Rat Pack made a dog...."
A20Y224WRCNFTH_17794,"For a ""B"" movie it is okay and since I enjoy watching them I did. But the acting was okay nothing special. Just put together with the characters having no common sense."
A298QR67XCMFRY_13049,"A coworker turned me into this movie, I'm not sure how the topic came about, but it was rather good.
A little dated but a good popcorn flick."
A3J1A5O13D0P7E_16888,Almost word for word. Bad acting. No feeling. This movie never should have been remade.
AELBTXV0OF9I9_10160,"A classic movie that I really enjoyed, and l would recommend this movie to any adult that loves horror movies."
A3LCEH26D48N2I_10341,I am very happy with this purchase.  I would gladly buy this movie again or recommend it to my friends.
A3AMAD9BEPID38_1373,This is both funny and scary if you are young. I seen it years ago and had to get it for my DVD collection.
A35R82JP5RIJKZ_6536,I thought this movie was dumb and perverted.  I finally watched it with my friend after 17 years. I love it.
A2CW8Q0OF3VXZ3_1435,"I'm a sucker for these movies, this wasn't the best but I still liked it."
A2X3W7V16IEH4P_6605,"love kevin spacey

love Thomas newman music score

recommend to all movie goers of all races in all countries now"
A2ZHSORK1HHYTT_9615,"Again, Al Pacino over the top and Keanu Reeves giving a wooden performance.

But, any film with Charlize Theron nude can't be all bad.

Give it a rental."
A3FAWECKLTI46L_1211,"Heard a lot about this movie.  Finally broke down and watched it.  I really didn't like it, It really didn't make any sense and it dragged to much for me.  I thought it was to slow and boring."
A14OINOL81CSM_14997,"Loved this movie when it first came out, had to have my own copy. Enjoyed the interaction between the characters and of course the Navy background."
A2VG8XM4TJQCOS_2067,"Digital beautiful copy of a great broadway musical. Heartwarming story. The extra material by the star, now grown up, shows how it affected her life."
A37AJLEEERBYPT_4418,I live this movie! Great quality for the price and came much sooner than expected.
A2WIU78SNJEUTE_5972,The premise and the situations the movie depicts are spot on for what it was like to be a high school kid in the 70s! Very engaging and a joy to watch and relive!
A2QO25UC5XYJWJ_20700,"It was awful, this story could have been good but got screwed up and became all about fighting, one fight after another.  the story was very week and just boring.  don't bother watching it."
A34Y9CIRYLDD2I_15680,this movie has never been one of my favorite Disney movies.  but the special features totally make this dvd worth having for any disney fan!
ANDZLSFNII2EW_15224,"Don't be afraid. I won't give any spoilers
and this is an excellent thriller. Two great
actresses of once: Debra Winger and
Theresa Rusell face to face. You'll enjoy
from beginning to the end."
A2BZ0DVSVFZ7L8_5737,"I have been looking for the rated ""R"" version, rare and HARD TO FIND!!
Thank you! I will be back for more!"
A186113ZDR3UWO_21063,Would not play in my DVD player. It was for the England market.  I want to return it.
ACMO36KT4IMBN_22798,"All style and little content. Filled with great actors, but no one is compelling in it. Story not worth following. Sorry. And I was really looking forward to seeing it too. Bummed."
A3J4GX5IY716PR_17891,No matter what....seeing Sophia Loren in a movie is always great.  This did hold my attention all though I don't think it is her best work.
AMI7BBFYZ7VUR_22693,I thought it was boring and I fell asleep after the first third of the movie.
A3LHU62NTEWZKB_1452,Great movie. The first of a great series. It has a lot of action and suspense.  If you enjoy zombies this is a good start to collect all four of them.
A2RD0HCFOVZJYI_4371,I liked this WW11 epic. Rally tells what it must of been like. If your a WW11 buff. You will want this one.
A2FXMI7RZQ8R3H_10895,"A romp through some very serious events. The actors all did a great performance with the tongue in cheek subject. By keeping in mind how the seriousness was being spoofed there are many funny, sarcastic, moments scattered along the way."
A1KMCGJO2DHSDG_19067,"I have seen and very much liked Gettysburg when it was in the movie theaters and want a copy for myself.  The one I received was grossly defective, but it would take too much time and expense to return it."
AQ8SX9HLM8KFW_3396,The Duke is hard to beat and some his early movie's are some of the best.
A1HG8JGO5FRYVV_22683,Low budget Mad-Max/Indiana Jones wannabe.  Zippo on special effects.  Zilch on plot.  Molly Ringwald is still cutesy.  Most props look like they were made in my next door neighbor's garage.
A3139J3877Y61F_21531,"I thought it would be more kid friendly because of the live animals. It's not. It is an ok movie, but not as good as the Disney version of The Jungle Book."
A1F9VCDD6O60QM_7901,"One of my favorite newer Disney movies. A classic in my eyes, such a beautiful story with a great message and characters you will instantly fall in love with. A movie generations will continue to love."
A2QKBP9MTIYCLH_11298,Meh. That's about all you can say about this movie. It was not worth the price to rent. Free is more like it
A10E5B6WI9GUM3_2213,"One of Charles Bronsons' best films ever! If you're a Bronson fan, you must add this one to your collection!"
A2B9NGZPJRM3BG_11701,but being loud when one is usually soft-spoken doesn't necessarily make for good acting. Tired plot. Couldn't sustain my attention.
A2X1GAG992U22_532,"I really like this movie. A movie with Harrison Ford and Gary Oldman. What a combination!!!
It is unusual because so much of it takes place on the plane but it works."
A2SO80MI0U1JUF_8311,It's a movie about a Disney princess -- For little girls (and big( WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?! She enjoys it.
A1K0UT3GA4QQG5_12232,"Very good production for it's time. The story is too simplistic, but it moves along well. However, younger generations  may not enjoy it and appreciate it's value as a classic."
A167W33DXLCQOR_12677,I was very disappointed at the sound quality of this video. The sound goes up and down and buzzes in various places. Have returned for replacement twice and so I have to believe the problem is with the Master Disc.
A2ZOOT9IT4U4KZ_20829,lousy reproduction my old vhrtts tapes are better even the packaging fell apart not worth 2 cents cliff perera
A30Q2ZBZFAS6QW_1426,I  LIKED  THIS  MOVIE  ALOT.  IM  NOT  ONE  FOR  SPOFF  MOVIES BUT  THIS  WAS  GOOD.  TEENS  WOULD  LOVE  THIS  MOVIE.  GREAT  GIFT  IDEA.
A6BY9TQXLYK3B_15405,"Read the book as a young boy of 12. IT was a powerful read. Most of the connect was what was in the characters ""head"". Does not translate to movie format."
A2MUY5FHJN4E85_12794,"Along with the Jack Benny collection it is required that I snag all of the Fred Allens I can, too."
AM54D10X2VA2_666,"Very good movie.  Richard Gere and Kim Basinger are really good in this movie.  Lots of violence.  So you have to like a  little violence.  I really don't but, this was good."
A28ILQ1UPL7K5Z_18158,"Actually, I should have said no stars!!  This fix was awful and I couldn't watch anymore and bailed after 20 minutes!!!!!!"
A2OIFAAO13Y7XI_16633,We enjoyed the movie.  It was interesting watching a mature couple form a love relationship.  I think they could have figured out an ending that made more sense.
A13V7OWOMYYA6J_22230,"I saws expecting the Kevin Spacey version. I generally enjoy British television, but not this. The humor was too much of an ""inside joke."""
A2MF0N72JVXDAP_17828,"Not as good as I remembered. Loved it as a kid but the plot gets pretty fuzzy, and deviates greatly from the source material with the inclusion of a magic amulet. Some films don't hold up over time."
AOO88G2LUYSAB_17237,"Nowhere near as good as Hairspray, but it's still a fun Waters flick to watch."
A24V5HBA2AC7AD_2217,Charles Bronson has a particular quality about his acting.  This film has a number of great fights(fake or not) in the film.  Would watch it over and over.
A1IBG0W7OUGY81_11816,Crap pure crap. God is love not fear. Too bad a cant give it no stars...
A27971Q20YCZA4_17153,We watched this because we were trying to watch all three in a row.  Definitely liked the first one the best.  This was a bit campy and I think I slept through some of it.
A201RUSH8UE2IO_23142,I thought this was average and maybe that's being too generous.  I watched most of the movie about two weeks ago and can't remember too much about it.
A23HSY7PY7MKQ6_21896,"don't like that Richard stops in between live band performance, What do we do then? Walk Away the Pounds is a little better"
A3KWFH1C5U7E7V_21770,"Remember this from years past. Still good story, but by todays standards not that special.  With HBO coming out with Westworld series good to see where it all started.  Actors are so young!"
A3SZA4U5QIMI1M_6137,"Loved it, storyline and lots of action! We are Van Damme fans and thus us the best of his action movies!"
A7DFI5YOVP5M7_13650,The ending was the best. She got the courage to addition after being afraid to try since she didn't have a dance background.
A2ZMZ4MXVW4KK9_18699,I love this movie and so does my daughter but when we got our movie it had the wrong bar code. I threw the package away that it came in so I guess that some money out the window.
A2KGQJWZ5HES4M_7882,"Very witty - actually a spoof on the classic Disney fairytales.  If you love the Princess Bride, I think you would love this."
A1SEJQQTN6H9IV_11561,"Pretty good Dangerfield film. Too bad he hadn't done more in his time. Funniest part was with the statue piece in pocket, oh my."
A2M1KBH07BNFHO_20146,This is not the movie described in the summary.  The movie I wanted to see was not an old black and white movie.  I was choosing movies featuring a certain actor.
AKJYMFM3FWB58_51,This is a very good movie. Henry Winker is excellent.  It is touching and will warm your heart for Christmas.
A3DBHQ8H61QSX9_14065,Turn off your brain cells and watch this purely for its status as a cult classic. Being made in 1968 there are no great technical tricks but if you can get past that and the totally bad acting...its pretty hilarious.
AIP4HAQV58SD6_9544,"Not one of Clint's best, but Eastwood nonetheless. The price was right, and its nostalgic for me, I first watched this movie when I was 11!BTW"
A2YCZ8T1X2FBV9_4704,"Full of suspense, one of the most exciting movies I've eve seen. The remake with Richard and Bruce stinks!"
AYRIN6TGLRCY9_7927,Very sweet and funny.  I watched with my 8 & 10 year old.  Some immodest relationship scenes were slightly racy with the Princess in a towel falling on the guy who was helping her.  All in all very good.
A20I10EXAI7DPR_18843,The aspect ration on this is 4:3. It is not a widescreen (16:9) format. I didn't realize this when purchased.
A10E1BCLDEVGSH_16887,Not for those with sensitive ears to profanity. Old movie.  Language a little racy for me.  Enjoyed the plot and acting though.
A11H1H0LX1JI7R_20707,"Too stupid for Young Adults, to violent for young teens. Has a few redeeming moments (along with the very beautiful Sophie Turner), but not enough to recommend it."
A3MRZE1XUK2A8X_538,Good story line. Harrison (good guy) does not disappoint and neither does Gary Oldman (bad guy)
A1N0LCPR7O7OLL_17565,Decent effects and more action make this one better than the first...But as far as I'm concerned that's not saying much.  Stephen Hopkins is a solid director though.  See Under Suspicion which he directed about a year or so ago.
A2AJ57CG4T153E_19553,"This movie got mediocre reviews in its initial theatrical release, and it's easy to see why.  It's still fun to watch and well worth adding it to my collection of obscure movies."
A20SWWOBXWNQ5H_16378,Very interesting story and movie! Sad in a lot of ways. I really like Maggie Smith and this is just an example of the wide range of characters she has portrayed.
AWR8FCOOJ7SX4_3632,"This is our 3rd copy, there are some areas where the sound fluctuates, but this is our favorite movie at Christmas time."
A1P7EE892UBLA6_2058,My granddaughter loves this movie. I wanted to get a copy of it so when she comes over we can watch it together. Thanks for your fast shipping and low price
A1AVYDDFRNZ3G0_14978,"False product description. I bought this DVD because in the description says close caption and subtitles (I already have this DVD with no subtitles), but it's exactly identical with the one I have. Only thing in the menu is episodes."
A26TZWLPUXPKQH_20408,"Kitschy franchise follow-up; rehashing basic sci-fi metaphors...go back in time, change the past, change the future, save the world.  Still pretty dark."
A290DD3N1ZDR0K_23822,"I don't know but it had subtitles which I didn't find where to take them off didn't need that movie , I love ghostbusters with out that"
A101KWKRNNUG5B_13756,I had forgotten how awful this movie is.  We had to turn it off after 15 minutes.  Bad. Bad. Bad.
A1E30G9O4132Z6_7813,I really like the Movie! It was what I really expected! I recommend it completely! I am very happy! Thank You
AAA9VK0SBM22D_1564,replacing VHS movies and this was one of them. Besides Wal-Mart was a little pricey for an older movie I think.
A269MVERAGGFGY_3992,"Unfortunately, the coloring is so lightly done that it does not look like a color version, but almost like sepia and pastel at times."
A2BQBRRKDUJAE6_9868,"This is a very intense, high action movie.  Expect to be on the edge of your seat the entire time with this high-charged drama."
A3L3XPNEH2OBJY_7786,This is such a feel-good film. Down and out girl hits the big time... I never grow weary of this film.
A1XR2AG68VN0CZ_23004,"This is one of the films that I remember from my youth.  Same themes, same so-so acting, but funny and a little bit cute:)"
AZT3AX3A4O809_3643,"I love these actors.  I just didn't like them in this movie.  Maybe it was the script, maybe it was the director, maybe it was karma.  Just didn't work for me."
AII2LU9BZ10NV_13869,Time was not kind to this movie. In 2015 it seems a lot cornier and racist.
A186T7M8IRYBWQ_17294,I was so disappointed.  I like Angela Landsbury but this is not one of her best movies.
AYJ70UU6MYCPM_22886,"Had high hopes for this movie, after all, Colin Firth is in it.  But, with the premise, degree of violence, the language and especially the ending, it will most likely appeal to teen age boys."
A1TLPN4IZPSH79_17983,"I mean, how many movies about drugging' and drinking'  bad behaving actors can the public put up with?  I'm a fan of Streeps, but this wasn't her best."
A3KLCBF2T6OLT0_4899,My old VHS finally bit the dust so I was pleased to be able to replace it with DVD. Old classic to be treasured. Never grows old and boring.
AJ3BK8AVZ6DME_7066,this was a great purchase for a great price. I'm big fan of Stallone's movies and this is one of my favorites
A3M2P9WPJWQG5T_8386,"Had heard a lot about this film and felt it was good acting, but only worth 4 stars."
A2U8DXUZVRFEUO_622,"AWESOME!! Great quality, plays great. Very happy, wanted this movie forever, loved this movie when I was younger lol, great price for great merchandise"
A1T1BB2KVPU39Y_2596,"Very well played story by Wynona, Michelle and Daniel Day.  The 1800's reflect how a wife keeps her husband.  A must see."
A1QNGKV688Q8TE_172,Joseph is amazing story to read and watch.  A person with the lord's help goes through trail. goes from a lovely shepard boy to the second highest person in Egypt.
A3BT6ZTOCWNHCF_20163,"bought this movie because i finally found it online, Movie quality is very poor, very dak and in letterbox format , so on my 60 inch Flatscreen i get a 12 in picture"
A30GXWRZ214GE4_14699,"commando raid was BS!!!!
I liked to see more of desert action, didn't care rommel & gang in germany !!!
stopped watching to see conspiracy which is dull for 2014!!
richard burton & british made it a comedy!!!!
3stars!!!"
A2K2GSY6ZCYBM8_15371,For fun and entertainment value it's hard to beat Burt Reynolds back in the day! These three films are Burt at his best and are action packed and funny from beginning to end!
A3FU4UD3Q105YB_4547,"for some really good laughs!! Wesley Snipes is a scream as ""Noxema"" as was John Leguizamo as ""Chi-Chi."" I love this movie, it was a ""must have"" in my DVD collection.  I would definitely recommend!!!"
A2ZSSYBY6OSB72_15481,"My husband loves this movie.  He thinks it teaches life lessons.  I found it entertaining, but didn't enjoy it as much as he did."
A2P95O5ACOF9EI_9400,"great movie, one of my favorites. thanks

this is a great movie, thanks everything was great."
A3IBEQ99CAI5JM_1255,"I love Wes Anderson's movies, he is one of a kind!! I recommend any of his movie, you will love them if you are not a ""normal person""."
A2NJPYDDCWCLDX_4508,I LOVE this movie.  I mean come on how can you pass up seeing these guys in drag????  The movie was in perfect condition and arrived before the estimated date.
A19DIUGM082WUC_4785,One of the greatest books ever written and still one of greatest movies ever made. I hadn't watched the movie in 20yrs or so since high school but I wanted to share it with my children and they loved it too.
A15WH5MB0JS30J_10986,My husband enjoyed it and agreed with some of the things.  We even let a friend watch it to see what he thought.
A29OYAXNBT0OMW_21297,I love the old B&W movies but these fell way short of my expectations. Definitely not in the same league as William Powell in the Thin Man series.
A15XGE8SPTTSFF_3246,"Leslie Nielson and Mel Brooks.  There is very little left to say.  If you like either of these great men, you will love them together."
A32YGX2KSVGFVP_10442,"I heard this had a great car chase, but I thought the movie dragged a little."
A1GSJ4TMAE2MYC_923,If you have not seen this epic science fiction event please don't tell anyone. Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Richard Dreyfuss. Music by John Williams is superb.
A1Y6J5OJVOHTKG_7357,Beautiful scenery.  I hate dementia.  At times hard to watch.  But a classic a need 4 your library of movie's.
A1YUBY4IO8EGYN_12285,"This movie was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this movie.  If you love Hockey, then you'll love this movie!"
A23QV5649GBRNX_2674,"This movie really scared me when I saw it in theaters. It was scary. But when I bought it, and watched it at my house. it wasn't that scary. But it was still good. BETTER THAN THE RING."
A1K4JR4U3TKTHV_12653,"this was not the movies that I had expected for my high school class,  I had to order a more ""teen-friendly"" version.  I think it is more suitable for junior college and university students."
A17FDL5LIGS1U0_7725,"Oh Julia, what more can we ask for, she did Great!  Gere was Gere doing what Gere does best.  Act!"
A1KL1DO76ZOECJ_12253,George Burns singing the Beatles...  How can you not get a kick out of that?
A22LWMO1S8ZQWO_16449,For an older film it was well done. Melanie Griffith definitely did a great acting job.
A29U2JAAFVHT2P_12991,Always love this movie. A beautiful vision of what could have been a young Sherlock Holmes.  For all the family.
A38ZGTG2NA310Y_1745,"If I've seen this 5x... I've seen this 50x!!! My granddaughter is now 5 and knows all the songs.  (Me too).  Soon, I will be sharing with the next group of grandkids.  Love it!"
AW4217138S10T_13595,"Adventure, Romance, Comedy, Magic and Dragons!  Add popcorn and you're off to a fantastic afternoon.  When Disney is involved in a movie, you know fantasy comes to life and all your dreams become adventure."
A1I7110J3IM9DZ_873,"A goodie/oldie movie. A sad but lovely story, One of my top favorite!!!!!! Amazing movie. Great cast, too. I have always loved this one."
A23SSHQJCD1CPV_11455,Did not like it at all. Wife thought it was boring. Watched about an hour and turned it off.
A2EBIAO3YJGMBA_14782,"This movie has some great actors.... William Shatner, John Travolta, and Tom Skerrit. The demon is played by Ernest Borgnine. Its a move that is very different but entertaining."
AKOEC3VYFSCTF_7275,"the movie is ok i guess, but Sharon Stone has to be the worst actress of all time. Arnold is like Laurence Olivier next to her."
A3R2V2EWE2D35R_3005,This is a very awesome movie that I feel didn't get enough attention or recognition.  I really dig it and am thrilled to finally have bought it for my movie collection.
A36UOGZTRFEZ92_14335,"It was an interesting portrait of a man that made a difference. However I got the distinct impression he would have preferred a world at continual war, no matter the casualties."
A2PL5TVNOIQE1W_23399,I would say the same thing about this movie that I said about Emma. I usually get films because of the cast. I didn't dislike it -- it was just okay.
AMS8CB113XYIL_16821,"The movie has a great cast doing excellent work, but overall this 'revenge' story with a strange morality message tacked on at the end just doesn't satisfy.  Ultimately it seems awkward and just a bit odd."
AFHX0CITLH3BB_14723,Once again Elvis is hip and ahead of his time in this odd and zany movie. Fun for the whole family.
A2XDCYA8763WSY_8938,It's all these guys in their later years so kind of goofy to see them as trying to be studs. Hackman is the best thing in the movie. BR continues to miss on the extras.
A2F9G63C1PJZOM_5253,"Had this on VHS but the VCR ate the movie so I had to replace it, one of my husbands favorite movies."
ANGGNFE8DXGYC_2748,"very good movie - interesting, historical reference. was only about the first lunar landing and it's 3 astronauts."
A3AO401ZZXT1NS_9340,Great US import - same extras as the DVD release but worth the upgrade.  Good performances and nice to see a remake which does something different rather than the usual bland carbon copies.
A3VUG0LK7L12EG_4085,Just rewatched this with my 12 year old daughter.  Inspirational on so many levels.  Daniel Day-Lewis is one of the great actors of our time.
A6EKCSZ2XWDGV_16905,"Portions of this drecky film were removed from the CA, which I really didn't want to see to begin with. I like Pacino as an actor and that's why I bought it."
A3TMBJ0JAGCJQJ_23072,Awful I had no idea from reading the synopsis just how awful and violent this movie would be. I am only glad we rented it instead of seeing it at the theater
A3UWM2JGOASDI4_18171,"Quit watching after 20 minutes of no story, action or any explanation what was going on. Don't waste your money."
ABQR5ZDH37TFE_12163,"It is still a very good classic movie. I'm not much of a zombie fan, but this one is fun to watch every now and then."
A3I5WEFXRDWDO3_15747,"Great 80's flick, fun and fast paced. I purchased this for my daughter and got to enjoy it all over again with her. Hoping that when she decides to baby sit her adventures are a little more tamed."
A1C7BNGSZB6K2F_21010,"Typical Japanese monster stuff. Not a classic like Godzilla or Rodan, but a brainless way to waste a couple of hours."
A3JG5LIZFCTRT4_1709,One of the best movies out there! It's even better watching it now than when I was a young child. Loved it then and love it now.
A1W8KACWQ7BCRK_8192,It's a pretty cute story and i liked the angels in it.  I like happy endings.  It has a pretty good caste of characters in it.
A2XZMS632R68M1_4535,This was just as full of humor as I thought it would be but the plot was even better than I expected.
A1SQS3N0RV3V6L_19813,"It was like watching a skit that you wonder, is it done yet?  It's very short and sad.  It just didn't have much depth to it and maybe that's because of the type of movies in the 50s.?"
A1R3SSPL58RXAN_6543,Was as good and suspenseful as when I saw it in the theatre!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone likes a good suspense drama.  Was please with the timeliness of delivery.
A1BIIR2Y91WO6F_5310,"Made back when movies had something of a story line instead of relying on sex, violence and gore"
A38DAPX1PSS5MF_13718,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Bad plot.  Could not understand the dialogue, especially from Robin Williams.  Not his best work."
A2EHBVLT0LOTXC_17283,"Funny, but not on the same level of classic, riotous hilarity as Brooks' masterpieces, ""Blazing Saddles,"" ""Young Frankenstein,"" ""History of the World Part I,"" and ""Spaceballs."""
A4LDLBSTWDUBK_16479,"Great history, but poor acting. OK for the history buff, but not exciting for those who also want quality acting, etc."
A3L9E0YI7C5G0W_12513,I do not like to review music purchases or movie purchases. If you didn't like the songs or the movie in the first place why would you bother buying it?
A19DTI38G8BRNI_9233,I liked the movie. It was different and had a lot of visual effects in it. The visual effect were good.
A37O1NA2JZL3VB_23272,"it would not load, kept stopping and starting. Bad service, Stopped trying after fourth halt in first five minutes ""air"" time."
AQAZIKYTCED37_14437,"I found this to be a very entertaining comedy/action movie.  As always, Danny Devito was excellent in his supporting role."
AYD6Z2EO6ZE28_18691,"It was presented a romantic comedy.  It was not.  Love Robert Montgomery, but he doesn't help this film."
A22RY8N8CNDF3A_12053,"The introduction and credits were quite long, boring, and ugly. After that beginning, I couldn't tolerate trying to sit through the rest. So I turned it off."
A24W772SLAVT6J_6357,"I watch both these movies whenever they are on TV.  Before now, I only had VHS copies and decided that I definitely needed to own them both.  This mini-collection made it very easy.  :)"
A31VYFJN38A8QI_15368,"This is a good transfer of this timeless classic.  It's never been one of my favorites, but this was good copy at a decent price."
AWGP22MVEXQVP_10140,"ADULT - Violence, sexual violence, murder, bad language, alcohol, drugs.
Tough guy drama and romance - Good versus evil. Good directing with low budget is how it got famous.
Some comedy mixed in."
A3G72G1NWSMS31_7837,We love watching these old movies and TV shows.  They make us smile and take us away from our daily stress.
AH0FYWRY8DCCN_17498,Don't like the film except for the last 1 minute.  Who has porpoise's in their swimming pools? Chlorine govt. allowable amount?
A3RZP97E7UD28K_7667,"this two movies are passionate and adventure with joy and great scenery, they don't do this anymore!"
A25KW7SOA78XAQ_14710,I love everything about the Muppets.  From the first movie to the most recent one in 2011 ad the TV show.  Even the Muppet Babies were alright.
A65GUVCKEE1OQ_9336,"Classic movie that everyone should have or at least for Hitkock fans. Great ending, but the rest is good as well."
AJDJV18FKOVQX_20007,"Very violent and profane. HBO film quality script. Beautifull western scenery, great horses. Cheesy acting and storyline"
A2F5UZ7VZDORAR_14555,what's not to like about a bruce lee movie with chuck norris in it - though it had many long boring stretches
A3KILLZE5EUFH0_7783,What can I say about this movie! The Actors are all wonderful and they are all endearing! Classic fairy tale movie!
A1YAS74J0T42FY_11937,"Love the movie of course. The online HD version is very crappy. I have a great 50"" tv and this movie even though it says HD looked really bad. Color was okay, but the detail was very bad.  Very disappointing."
A1EBSIFGF0OCAX_13463,Trouble watching to many delays I can watch from Netflix better. Was hoping Amazon had improve this since I tried the last time.
A1VBZF7PWABPGW_1431,I rented this movie to laugh at based on the previews. As it is now one of my favorite horror films and I own the DVD. Great film especially with a  huge bowl of popcorn.
A2Z2BSFKQT5IEM_14341,"Great movie i saw it many years ago, i am still amazed as to the event and how that prize attack took place with very little knowledge on the US."
A1TJRU70870HCT_5424,I loved this movie. I showed it to my children's Sunday school class and they enjoyed it as well. It really helped illustrate the Bible story and bring it to life.
A28YK7V9AJO0AI_20471,"As usual, Robert Duvall's acting was phenomenal - why I purchased the movie - BUT the movie itself was pointless and boring.  My husband and I fell asleep.....when we woke up Robert Duvall's character was dead!  Enough said."
A3PC2Y2CY3ST2C_5925,"Quite possibly the single worst movie ever made! I sincerely hope that Hunter Thompson couldn't be that big of an @$$#0le in real life, but I've heard he was. Wasn't crazy about the book either."
A3E7S0M42G1JC0_5316,This is a great movie with John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn they are both fantastic people. Gave this to my husband who loves to watch westerns especially with John Wayne in them.
A16J6HOBIC1A3M_5054,"If you get the book you really should buy the movie. I think the book is much, much better but it's good to have a set of anything. Guess that's the real reason I bought the cliff notes book."
A1TRF7YIT5HT7Q_12344,What was the point?  Acting was good but the story made no sense to me.
A1Z66WYC32ZUSX_19570,"Cute movie....great actors in an unusual configuration. The Pink Panther Movies with Peter Sellers are better; if you've not seen these actors together, here's your chance....maybe I viewed it on a bad day; it wasn't as funny as I expected."
A2ISI5QWQRFPXX_4294,Good WW2 depiction of a Battle that cost too many lives and was needed for it was not a Decisive one.
A1CN60TRXFWGUO_20251,"Kind of a low-budget Canadian production about ferrying aircraft from Canada to the UK during WWII.  Interesting, but kind of campy."
A3CLQZ22LQZOUX_11035,I didn't like this at all.  I felt it was a waste of time and money.  I wouldn't recommend it.
AIXWU9UK6WQUY_22361,"This is a violent, boring, silly movie. As a spoof it fails, as an action spy thriller it fails miserably. Shame on Colin Firth for being part of this. Samuel Jackson saves what small parts are worth watching."
A6F8PI0O7E789_1236,"damaged dvd, did not play it until I had had it for a while, so just sucked it up as a loss"
A2FK9X0TX8Z8T1_17253,"Region protected for region 1 ,therefor useless for UK and Europe. Why do you sell them in the UK and Europe ?"
A29TX0495VMKN3_17687,No sound. The movie appeared interesting but without sound you may as well be looking at a painting on the wall.
AOWZQAE1TO0IA_23821,What a letdown.....this is absolutely nothing........a tragic waste of time that does not hold a candle to the the Original.  Just a poor attempt to make some more money from the Original
A3RVDXHXWXI6K4_3314,My 4 year old nephew really loves this movie. I was happy to see how much he enjoyed it. Good value
AQ3UBU5VV74CB_9692,I loved this movie! The trio worked well off each other; they were funny & inspiring.
AYBOLETFQZF8R_2528,"Just as I remembered it.
Pretty cool movie. Schieder was definitely under rated as an acting talent."
AXGICW8EV77YT_5077,this film is worthy of all its plaudits over the years.  Gregory peck is marvelous.  the story packs a thunderous theme.
A3RO2KO4IGMII1_4507,This comedy deserves its cult status  It examines issues that are central to American culture and provides insight into an alternate life style
A2ETGG6M02VCEP_7423,"I first saw this movie when I was about 14 years of age, I really didn't appreciate it until much later in life.  It is wonderfully acted, and a great story of redemption and lasting love."
A1D44U2MPO993M_6291,"Light, funny, tender. No great truths, but Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts send off believable sparks. Great views of London. Great supporting cast."
ANP0AC5FJISWH_15934,nice item. price is good. couldn't have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.
A3JR2RBHI5BSQ4_11197,"Not quite what I remember as a youth but still enjoyable enough.  Very British though, with some now very out of date views of the world."
A1X8F0R1F2RFY7_7018,"All I'll say is everyone I've seen this movie with has said ""BY FAR--- BAR NONE-- IT""S THE BEST MADE, MOST UNDERRATED, SCARIEST FILM OF OUR TIME"".
Watch for wells."
A296T0V5DM036U_5906,"I am in the wrong age group to be impressed by this movie. I had just finished reading the ""Rum Diaries"" and wanted to view this movie. The book was excellent."
A3U5RC83IITZLQ_10120,Not as good as the first by a long shot.  I made the mistake of watching these movies consecutively.  The humor begins to get old.
A3J3ONUL0JBJ8X_11881,The movie just repeats itself and is just a bunch of clips put together to make it appear longer than it really is
A1W1DCV7PFDGY0_597,Great movie and fast shipping. Movie looks and sound great. Like new. Movie will always be a good watch. I can watch it numerous times and never get tired.
AV5SHEPOVKGCB_11856,This was a good video for a rainy Saturday afternoon.  It was a very predictable storyline but I enjoyed it.
A1D5SJAOYKUK5O_16662,"I remember really liking the typical Fletch/Chase one-liners from this film, but after watching it again after probably 15 years it didn't have quite the same impact. Still a funny movie but not nearly as good as the first movie."
A2GQRW70W0VO8Q_13874,Not bad for an old werewolf movie. I remember seeing this as a kid it was a lot scarier back then.
A1P1J9V86UZ9DZ_21969,"The picture was hardly ever able to show up clearly, and the sound was too fuzzy sounding.  I like the DVD version better."
A1DMY544XRDGFL_21168,If Disney redid this movie with better graphics it would be extraordinary. The story line is great. Try it y may like it
A3DVPHGB4K1FIE_3062,"Well, the premise may be interesting but it doesn't hide the fact that the movie is just plain boring. It doesn't get off the ground and its really painful to watch."
A331OF34UX4Y1K_17248,"I don't care what were the director's intentions. The result was a silly, poor film, that fortunately didn't harm Depp's career."
A22GI2VTY0RRJO_22931,"By today's standards, the ""aliens"" were not very good.  The plot was easy to follow and it was a little entertaining but could not keep my interest"
A31MI0H2B1L2VC_4187,Well worth a watch. Realistic. Decent acting by relatively unknown actors. Focus is on surviving and less on heroics.
A22NYH15MS5WMR_10763,"Based on the reviews I've read, I'll be skipping this one, would rather see an unaltered original story, thanks for the reviews!!"
A2I3MWO1V0F36M_21085,"I love this film, but the blu-ray looks awful, it's full of grain.  Sadly no attempt was made to find deleted footage (see trailer) and reinsert it into movie. The 2000 special edition dvd looks better. Don't waste your money."
A1IBS3KI6WV5W4_12343,"Good movie! Somewhat surprised to see how graphic the movie is, considering its film date. Great acting by Nicholson, Bergen and Ann-Margaret. Art Garfunkel was amazing! Recommend!"
A3AJJVSEBKIENV_23362,"This is a pretty good depiction of the story, but is much more scary than the book.  My seven year old granddaughter loved the book, but was not happy with this animated version"
A385RGOF0B0GE5_10144,"It may have been that my expectations were a bit high coming into watching this movie, but it was okay."
ACI2YHHDAB8UC_2776,"Great movie.  Gets your attention about and awareness up.  Causes on to think how situations can be controlled within the government.  Strange as it may seem, this movie was made before the Clinton incident."
A3OR6SHC6C38NC_23974,A movie from the pile. I didn't understand the plot and the performance wasn't adequate. I did not like it
A19BLTFP0N8HWE_4225,This is a great movie to watch and it's also one of my favorite movies. Highly Recommended
AGYBPDHM8JRI1_12843,Des aspects  pertinent mais trop  de choses  ont voulu  tre  montr&eacute;  en un  temps  r&eacute;duit  ce qui  donne  des contresens  et malheureusement  des erreurs.
A1457FZDPA8S6S_21696,"Gets more into martial arts than it does into sci-fi. It was okay, but I'm glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater."
A2AT8IWU9I4FG_23381,I watched the series on TV so I thought I'd watch the movie. It was ok.
AH83MZNL0856S_10165,It is a matter of preference. This film does nothing for me. It is not even comedic. Some people just love it and good for you. I find it to be trite. Not even silly. It is well filmed.
ALFDUUJXDJV6J_11462,It was ok. It got a little to difficult to understand just what was going on at times. Would not highly recommend it.
A3SMS5S49VFPYW_4634,Brilliantly played by all cast members.  Have wanted to see if for some time and it did not disappoint.
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_21745,"Cheesy movie, really bad even for a b-movie, saw it a while back on late night cable. Really cheesy."
A2YNS2M3XFZ0FR_19095,"I signed on to this movie, mainly because of the director's reputation.  This was not one of his best movies."
A2UX5ABICURKL5_2670,"I like this version a lot better than what they showed in the movie theatre,
It told the story better.
As far as the American version this one was better.
I rate this DVD a 4 of 5 stars!!"
A3DSBBMJZKP74M_10923,This movie shows how prejustice is not only black and white but it goes across the board with different nationalities.  It only happened that the woman was more understanding than the man and his friends.
ABMZEDXIX70SP_4927,The only thing is my boys will not sit still and watch it. I wish it was less talking and more cartoon. Will try again and see what happens. But a good dvd for a older child other  than three.
A21VL7TF0TZ7KT_19749,"Quirky film, had never heard of it until I did a search for Jimmy Stewart movies. Saw it once, that'll do."
A23J4PB9RVAK9K_21514,"If you like to watch brutality without any story, this for you.  We only watched about 15 minutes before we shut it down so it could have gotten better."
AZNPZJAICL316_8257,"Haven't tried the blue ray disc yet, but the dvd plays great, and it arrived earlier than the expected date."
A3E4EN8NV92TUE_9310,"So artistic.  The opening credits are some of the best in Movie history.
Love the movie.  Never gets old. Great direction."
AE5MHPBQ1HB8T_12666,An oldie but goodie.  Very well done movie.  O'Toole and Burton were excellent.  Also recommend  A Lion In Winter.
AAQ9CPQNDWIW_18283,"This was an interesting part for Errol Flynn to play.  Errol was outstanding in this movie. Bring to the screen another side of himself, which is enjoyable to watch."
AQEM21YQI67G1_3096,"The movie itself is fancy but the scenes of erotic dance performed by Demi Moore are fantastic, Love to se it over and over again.

carlos"
AVCJDW1WPJ5Z1_10803,"Not until the original theatrical editions are restored and released will I spend another dollar on Star Wars films.  If viewers want these films, please purchase them; but for the rest of us, we will continue to wait."
A28Q4WAMAFOE1T_2159,One of my all time favorite movies.  Doing what you have to do compared to dreaming about it.
A28V2ZCVGKTKGI_10965,Love to buy DVD's on Amazon because you get such great deals -- this was one of them.  Paid only a few dollars for a brand new DVD!
A38XWR70CWW7F9_21210,"I forgot that half this movie is in sub-titles.  I also forgot that Ron Jeremy tried to get into acting by being a bank worker in this, LOL."
A1ABI2GH9C5FG0_20672,This was a gift for my Mother. She said it didn't come across as a legit S.K. story. Just ok.
A1E9329NFKHV9H_1715,A couple of t he best songs were deleted and new ones added.  The live stage version is much better.
ARBJ2KTHX1WCL_19591,"It was okay at best.  While the message  was thought provoking, the acting just didn't seem to support a good show.  Had I seen it before I purchased it, I would not have purchased it."
AG77MZ4MV0VDK_11087,"The Amazon Instant Watch version cut out at least one song, the duet with Scrooge and Belle at the end of their engagement.  Kind of disappointing.  Great movie, would be five stars, not sure why it was mangled."
A1MTVBBD4HJI3S_13394,"Action is good acting good remember it was made many years ago.  However,  if you've  seen the more recent ""Into Darkness""  you may want to watch this alternate time line!"
A2DDDZ6FF5DNGF_12694,"Then watch it. I only gave it three stars, because it really didn't have a chance at the Original On Any Sunday movie."
A3RNLJ8UD1T5M5_9269,Christopher Lee was the best Dracula ever. Don't know why I have to say so much. It should be enough that I liked the movie.
A2LSATAKB0IAQI_12217,It was fun '50's sci fi. I remember watching this on the moona- Lisa  show on tv when I was very young. She was the Elvira of the early '60's here in San Diego back in the day.
A26CEJL5AR4U3B_11924,Please note that this is not the 1949 version with Jennifer Jones.  This is the 1991 version with Isabelle Huppert.  The mixed information above led me to buy this even though I had already seen (and disliked) the Huppert version.
ARIO6GBFUBUR7_5201,"If you like stupid humor, then this movie is for you. This was Steve Martin's first movie and from a time when he was still at his prime. Enjoy."
A2UYQL5PB6A7OZ_19982,Parts of this seem over done. Just becomes repetitious and a bit tiresome toward the end.
A39T9LASIYKN1L_17129,"Awful movie.... love Ben Affleck... but Awful just awful
I paid full price for this movie and just want to break it... can not
tell you one redeeming thing... but Ben Affleck in it"
A2D79RSV2U8RIA_17172,Glad the original came with this set as I do not like the revised versions.  The movies are timeless but I wish they would have been left alone.
A3DZZW4J5J0NTG_14398,I remember Night of the Grizzly as a child. I've looked everywhere for it. It's a great movie.
A1IFGHBHBHI54P_22967,"I was so disappointed with this movie. Although the action was great and the acting was superb, I wish they would've cut down on the cursing in this movie!"
A2ILHT5DLZM6LI_8118,"I loved the emphasis on family, The acceptance of all creatures great and small. The action scenes were pretty good too."
A3KNQGD4ZO5RLY_1282,"Classic angst, I still feel the same now as a had when it first came out."
A1WRR1RB0P82JZ_5654,"Of course, the discs are fine. But the big reason I bought this was for the Universal 100th Anniversary slip cover, and that wasn't included in the packaging at all. I'm quite disappointed about that."
A12NG64J2BCQS7_21172,If you want to watch a two hour long infomercial selling you on the wonders of AA then this is it. If you want any real info on addiction go buy a book by Stanton Peele instead.
A2NQ7OUTVQFIBT_16533,"It's a great story. Unfortunately if you read the book you want more. I personally think if it had been done as a miniseries
like Shogun it would have been better, but hey, that's just me"
AWI6I5SZ85G4C_2763,This movie is very good but pretty sad in the end though. I couldn't say for words about this movie so I figured I would give this 5 stars!!
A14SYLU57RYJ14_11253,"Great music and scenery. There is a lot to like.  But the political correctness, and the demonization of the evil white man is getting more than old."
A3LMBPLGRDZ6OG_3391,"Grew up on this movie, now my kids can enjoy it as well.  Truly awesome movies, need to be made classics one day :)"
A9ZT45HWV8N9D_23011,The babies love this bear. His antics are entertaining and amusing for the little ones.
A1NLBBHE55RZ8A_2027,"Comical, good music, well acted. If you like musicals, this should float your boat!  Albert Finney is name recognition but the actress who played Annie ...made the movie."
A8E2K33PSIZIT_4943,This is one of my old time  favorites.  What a story to tell and most of all to watch...
A60F2GOL7U5RO_16428,"the first one was better, the 2nd wasn't too bad but this was the worse."
A2ET90HQ5AI83E_15585,"decent euro-inspired, rip -off of the Exorcists success. If your a product of the 70's. Your sure to enjoy this grind-house cheesy pleasure."
A101IGU6UDKW3X_19824,This came out at the tail end of the Naked Gun era. A few genuinely good laugh but for the most part it tries WAY too hard and doesn't deliver.
AS4JFWR1OFWYW_10535,Man if I could sum up my break'n dreams in the 80's it was this movie and it's sound track. Go grab some cardboard and get down on it!
A1LK1JUTPI2X7L_6168,Great baseball movie with the side tension of Chapel's relationship with Jane and her daughter.  It is as much of a love story as it is a baseball story.  Kevin Costner does well.
A3VYMX7M1KEVNZ_21359,Many models r considered beautiful- but r they really?- this woman has a beautiful heart- which makes her outward beauty so much more precious & rare.
A16005YUCER5Y6_18732,I was surprised to see how this film had aged. Despite a good cast and solid production values the direction seems old fashioned with overacting the norm. Still a clever plot but...
A3DDOWB48EXARH_14736,"Classic comedy. Not exactly the height of highbrow film-making or anything, but it's funny, heartfelt and gloriously features Dolly Parton."
A2509EN5IKBBNU_1344,"This is a great movie.  With top notch acting, a great story, and some nasty gun battles.  Just buy it you will not be disappointed."
A3595Y8VK6Q3HL_18163,"Beautiful locations, special effects and half clad woman, especially Victoria Vetri bring this to life! Fast paced, enjoyable prehistoric actioner, in the same world as Hammer's One Million Years B.C."
A5J887TUVUXDM_19016,"After psyching ourselves up so much for this, I admit I'm a bit disappointed.  It was ok but not up the caliber of their other endeavors...."
A3UGD3PSYW2V6Y_15162,"LOOK UP SpielbergFilms.com

3RD FROM THE BOTTOM."
A2J08PJFA7WGKJ_12598,"Nothing special.  Just wanted my boys to see some of the movies I grew up watching, but then I forgot that my boys shouldn't be watching THIS movie! Lol!"
A20BHA430QDYV2_16615,This is a great movie with wonderful dancer actors.  It gets me up and dancing myself.
A1SD1YAREPV6DD_19466,"25 % into the video, still had nothing to do with the book !!!!!!  Made everything into slap-stick joke.  This was ""Bill Murray"", not Somerset Maugham."
A14VILRYV2OUGW_20152,"Sure, these old skiffs from the fifties and sixties are really 'corny' by today's standards, but old sci-fi buffs like me can still enjoy 'em!
4 stars for DVD quality."
A3APVCF9G6EVCF_2958,"The case was very battered, dirty and the movie had some scratches, but the movie plays beautifully! (4 Stars only because of the condition of the item.)"
A2BPNL9FYEYMBW_21124,Not as specific as I was thinking it would be. The photography is great but detail short. I would recommend this to another as a pleasure view.
A2KK8W2WV5BNTL_2514,I've seen it a thousand times. It keeps getting better every time I watch it.
A36RYZG39M9D95_9406,"Clint Eastwood demonstrates his diversity as an actor in Bronco Billy.  Viewers expecting to see him in one of his bad boy roles will be disappointed, but the movie is certainly not disappointing (other than Sondra Locke's presence)."
A20E9T3TDSI9FW_12082,Totally corny. Fun to watch if you like the old sci-fi movie genres before CGI and someone actually put some thought into a script.  At least hairspray was used sparingly in this flick.
A8PYKA72J0DN4_1864,"Fashion and murder, like those Italian slasher flicks.  But instead of Goblin music, there's KC and the Sunshine Band!  Faye Dunaway's great as a prude who enjoys photographing beautiful people pretending to be dead.  Then they really start dying."
A2GZO74XC35PKM_1232,"Excellent acting for all but not deep enough story. Could have been more to it, I think. Good photography."
A1Y14JQQ87ZZ9Q_14808,"I wanted to like this movie, but you just cant.  Gene Hackman sucks in this movie.  Its just an over dramatic made for tv type movie that is just boring as all get out."
AEYT0S4O55M6E_15130,"Movie is good .  It's really all Judy Garland.  Watched in the 1970's, not as good 2nd time around.  But still wonderfully Judy.  James Mason is always good."
A2VR0UH2AQMEJV_23402,"Problem was the actors. The story was good, but the male lead was not believable in the role to me.."
AEOC8FO07PJAW_2431,"This was a really good movie, I learned that they showed it to my kid in chemistry last year (?)! He and I both had fond feelings about it, a nice looking cast too.  =)"
A10H5OA0UX7E5I_16624,I just love this version of Phantom of the Opera with Robert Englund he is one of my favorite horror actors like Nightmare on Elm Street.
A2I4OJ24XSTZU5_11532,"If you love blood, guts and gore you will love this dark humored horror film. I love films that make you laugh and scare you all at the same time. This movie has it all."
A1R5DPGERMEZKG_1840,This was the first time I saw this movie and it is ranked as one of my all-time favorites.  Love the cast.  Love the clothes.  Makes you want to take up fly-fishing.
A10JDPEQ8GJ2K1_19379,"Not a masterpiece, and Soderbergh has made better films (like Traffic), but a good film and a definite improvement on the original Rat Pack version."
A2JGAFWN63QPR4_9000,I'm not a fan of the movie - but the documentary Dangerous Days is so much more interesting than the movie itself!
A29SRO9Q4Y4VS8_9922,movie is really good and will have you on the edge of your sett at times.
A2DVXLHVYS1VVE_20689,"Worse than Last Tango in Paris.  The epitome of overrating.  Silly, 60's-type self-indulgent, introspective idiocy."
AMSORNUI0AVTE_22944,"If you enjoy old-school movies, you'll like this one. Otherwise it's very predictable and a bit stilted on the acting side where Mr. Guinness seems to pose for the camera a lot."
A17K0QRI47WHUL_15365,Bought for my wife to help finish her collection of Disney classics.  Still a great movie after all these years.
AJNOMZ1D2141Y_2237,"Really, what else can I say about one of the funniest movies ever made? If you're not worried about extra special features, grab this version as cheap as you can."
A1WP1RAL9K8V95_14410,"I am biased because I really like Clint Walker. The story is a good vs. evil with Walker having to be a good man to his wife, partner and villain. Fun to watch."
A2MORASKNQYQAN_4946,This story and its portrayal in this movie is ageless. Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore and the actors are not as outstanding as these.
A2Y2TME495JL01_10359,"It reminds me of when I was a kid, and is just kind of fun. I love the music in the film & Dick Van Dyke is great."
A2H1J0WGGPGYJ_20552,"The book is filled with such interesting ideas and takes on the themes contained within.  The film seems to ramble a bit with those ideas, but still very intriguing."
A2TIPSSR8ZS8P0_10590,"A very nice portrayal of the problems of veteran adjustment after World War 2. Made in 1946, so does not suffer from hindsight."
ANTSC8UV4RJU6_20464,"This movie was okay, but slow in parts. A good one to watch at least once. Robert Duvall is one of my favorite actors."
A241U93517EY0H_20817,The movie is in B&W. I didn't expect that since the cover is color.  The plot moves slowly compared to more recent movies.
A3SGJNKRBXGB20_21069,"disney type fare with some amusing moments, if it is raining and the younger kids are bored, this should keep them captured for a bit"
A1WE81WPBDQB7B_18497,I normally like the old ones but I fond Doris Day to be overly girly for her age and Gable to be overly brutish. These two don't make a good pair in this one.
A2WI6MZWIQQILY_14709,"That's about it...low on extras. But I have been waiting for all of the Muppet movies to be on DVD, so here I am."
A29EOSS8VB85BJ_18988,It was an okay movie. Definitely it was no epic. Not one of Hestons best movies.
A2TT4DBAMQSCLD_18472,"I really liked the first 2 so much, action, suspense, good stories but this one was just the wind down I guess. To finish the series it would be good to watch. Love the actors regardless !!!"
AG1M4XYLBPCXN_15202,I like war movies and this one i like. the movie has a few well known actors in the movie.
AKDKCSP91K7ZW_16191,Old fashioned but a fun two hours watching two of our best comedians at work! I'd share it with PG crowd!
A2XFBCWNNNG4OQ_20576,Old  Movie with Cary Grant and Jeanne Crain. Kind of a thin plot but good to watch anyway because both of them are good actors.
A2GOY29RAWTWUW_5804,"Wonderful movie for entire family.  Disk has English and French audio.  Our multi cultural family would have enjoyed it even more, had Spanish audio been available on this disk."
A3HUN3KP383B23_2469,"I had the DVD but, I was updating my collection to Blu-ray.  If you like science fiction then this movie for you.  Recommend the Blu-ray copies than DVD because they are play better and crisper than conventional DVDs."
A3UZQ1IW3XUZ73_21479,"Here we have dependable Randy Scott in a good railroad Western  flick, well worth watching from time to time. The supporting cast is fine, and Columbia Studios did an excellent job in their production; good color print."
AZ1AYNO6N9ZBS_5009,"What can you say about a great movie about the greatest book ever written?  If you haven't read or seen this masterpiece, shame on you.  One would have to be illiterate not to be moved by Harper Lee's timeless story."
AHHCJGSM8EVD1_19739,"I think this is an ""uncut"" version.  Did not like the bad language etc. It is not a family movie."
A20D2ZFUVB06QI_5685,"Great movie but there's not anything special about the Collectors edition version. If you're a fan of comedy, John Belushi, John Candy, Dan Akroid...you'll love it."
A1U1QNZ7FT6JLG_6464,"Frankly, she needs better material because she's better than these boring films she's making.  This was a very forgettable story about a free spirit who is charming and causes ripples all around her."
A2OMWIEOCH3NJ9_8387,Too much bad language.  The idea was okay but the language ruined it for me.
A2HJHXBEUSYYGI_4798,It's To Kill A Mockingbird....it's going to get 5 stars. :) My high school students really enjoyed this film and appreciated the purposeful choice the director had in filming it in black and white
A3NUIHWHPJCZN3_23535,"Well, the picture on front has nothing to do with the movie but was glad to have it anyway. Thanks anyway."
A3BOIP165TRNJ1_7742,love julia and love richard. love them together. classic american romance. feel good and will stick with you after :)
A9JVFEE71PB7A_4839,"One of the best movies of all times.  I can watch it over and over and still learn something new. The themes of race, prejudice and injustice are still relevant today."
A1AQFDSM1F22L4_21149,"What a wondrous story filled with magical and whimsical characters! A young boy has the adventure of a lifetime when he allows
his spirit to run free and his imagination to soar. All through the power of the written word."
AEG1PD72BN98R_11504,"this movie is enjoyable for it's scenery of India, explanation of custom, and sexual storyline. Some detractors are the acting at times is sub par but the movie never slows..."
A2H3XNH83M8H56_11448,"It obvious that Argento and co. have created a visually and aurally impressive film, however I can't but help feel that other aspects such as characterization and plot are somewhat limp."
ACY8GDNPG887M_6353,"The story was really a typical one. The only good thing about the movie is Hugh Grant, he acts well and he's very handsome !

The picture and sound quality was not good at all."
A3T0LQU7D0KADX_16710,Great movie but you cannot remove the Chinese subtitles on the bottom. I still gave it 3 stars because after a while the subtitles didn't bother me.
AQY2D6PEIHQ7L_17386,"This movie had an excellent storyline and the acting was great but the language (especially the ""F"" word) made the movie difficult to watch."
A2C1IV4YNZO20V_3736,one of my all time favorite movies - so i glad to have found it for such a reasonable price
A38063DHC5X7AJ_20749,A lot of violence but a quirky kind of fun. Nice that it had a spikey hug type happy ending
A27AQXLIJZ73BP_16727,"Not the greatest movie, but if you are a Weird Al fan and love the wackiness, then it is a fun and enjoyable movie!  Actually has a solid storyline."
AWY8SGPOU9F6M_2502,This is what I would call a classic must see movie. It is a unique story line and the directing and acting was great!
A2FU0H0NUU2YVS_5509,"Good old' Chris Reeves in a complete different role than we normally remember him in.  Along with Kirstie, Linda, Mark Hamill and the others it's a great cast doing this remake.  John Carpenter did it again."
A2DIUX40LCGIPC_10913,"I wanted to buy this on Blu-Ray, but I see they molested this version like they molested the DVD version.  I guess I won't be buying it...  Thanks a lot idiots!"
A1WQAIT7SFDI8D_7260,we liked this older movie it's pack with a lot of action and you can't go wrong with van Damme movie's
AO13M90UB5DPR_11125,"Great movies, good price and came quickly! Will gladly order from this one again. Disk was as stated and works well. Fun trip. Thanks! Good memories."
AMHLRPLTM9ICP_10167,"Elvis best movie ?
That would be ""Follow That Dream"".
This is a close second."
A3C9P5G60LMYIY_12968,"If you can sit through it, you have guts.  The characters are ghastly, self-absorbed and obnoxious.  Completely over-rated.  But if you loved Beaches, Steel Magnolias and other sentimental crap like that, you might like this."
A3LDRMKLSUWTJ_2577,"The performances were good but the movie was kind of slow.  It is a good example of the tragedy some people go through because of societal rules, regulations, preferences, and traditions."
AB4ZGWRDU7VRB_17169,It was a copy of Halloween and it used Jamie Lee Curtis to make some money it was confusing and was written verry messy just see this movie and you will see what I mean
A3W0A847OEYQU3_13121,This is one of those old school joints that I will keep on watching and watching over and over again. I almost forgot how funny these two are.
A3QAV7LALVG1F7_19296,"Why isn't this on dvd??

It's not fair I tell you.

It should be on dvd for those of us
who don't have Blu-Ray.

What gives?"
A2585WX4R9CMMS_14276,I had never seen this movie.  It has aged very well. Great story and acting. I like WW II. History.
A2LD4KP01VJVK3_23125,Studio logo cropped...looks like a VHS print with poor quality...other than that a fine film
APR0J7DPJUW5X_3468,This movie is epic. I mean it puts the hurt on SF. Gotta love a JD movie.
A3L5CMH7CLQPI0_14310,Very funny and I laughed out loud...watch it every couple of years...always relish a belly laugh.
AWJ5DQZU3OOJ0_2887,"Movie was awesome! Kathy Bates & Jennifer Jason Leigh are indeed pros. On top of the great acting, the book that the movie is based on was written by Stephen King, and it was great! Definitely a must-see :)"
A1FHBAI2QR7C5E_11857,Romantic. Clean. Little cheesy on the acting. Great costumes and scenery...but it's got nothing on The Scarlet Pimpernel and all it's beauty!
ASZXXK47CY2OZ_15076,any movie with Sam Elliot gets a least 4 stars. It told a good story about how life was in the seventies
ARJQMR7HJI7V_20254,"Crappy continuity with Korean War and Cold War aviation products and instruments. This is a really, really bad movie. Don't get it."
A242NHKVYIYHHP_5631,"My favorite move that was a commercial disaster. I like this movie. Yeah, it is a little all over the place and a bit long but it is undeniably funny with memorial performances from a number of actors."
A2ZKNGL20FBK2I_10642,"I will break my own law and comment on something I haven't seen, but it's because I CANNOT watch it! For this price we really deserve the DVD set as real DVDs!"
A1KO7TPRBFLB1W_683,"This was a very good movie, was filmed in a place where we used to live,"
A2ZX737E8UNVMS_13272,Love the movie and love Harrison Ford in it.  It is a good movie to watch over and over and enjoy.
ABFW2X0CMQM24_3774,Have always loved this movie. Started watching it in black and white and when it came out in color I enjoyed it even more. Great holiday movie to set and watch as a family.
A1VXL56DT59AZO_9486,"I enjoy naval movies so I thought, ""What the heck, why not?"" I would not say I wasted the money spent, but I don't expect I'll be viewing this movie a second time."
A3LPIHGT70010Y_13686,"good old classic that inspired many other movies, dance and music. we just went to a broad way production in Sacramento ca and had to watch the movie again."
AI8M4AETAD2OL_20976,A tale of betrayal and revenge in the old west - Marlon looks good but I never realized he was so short.
A1JBVQQ9Q91BWY_13252,"great movie from clint Eastwood , one of his best ones he has made, it`s worth watching and owning, based on a true story."
A9Z59TE5JRPWF_18789,"Fair transfer, but not great. Might be waiting a long time for a Blu-Ray of this fun film, so pick it up only if you are a fan."
A1EVXRDQDDS0EU_14066,"The characters aren't interesting, so it's kind of boring. Usually Cary Grant will perk up any picture, but not here."
A1P0CQGJQSQP32_18866,To me that did not look like a remastered film. The picture quality of the public domain DVDs looked better.
A3FQGOCTI5940Q_10258,"Ok for a vintage flick and much better than CG generated horror flicks.
CG = Computer Generated"
A1WQLCLHURMZXL_2551,"I saw this movie years ago and decided recently to purchase it.  I love the story line and actors.  It might be considered a ""chic flick"" but guys should enjoy it too, especially because of Michael Caine."
A1GKYECU55KO9S_15065,I did not buy this and I have no idea why I have it on my review list.
A2FOM4FQA4LSKL_614,just like the VHS version i owned as a kid. great to watch when i need a throw back!
A1XN5I2HBIB69S_14294,Stopped the video when the language became what we consider to be unacceptable.  So - did not watch more than 15 minutes of it.
AG2Z8SMS9DPE0_1386,Awesome scenery. I like the social styles of the groups mingling. I've seen it many times.
A13S4A95QXMBT_13011,Pretty corny with some really bad acting.  It was interesting to see a very young Kevin Bacon.  Definitely worth watching to see Camp Crystal Lake  counselors utter some hilarious lines.
A1BE1OKY80FUBH_2361,"A classic movie that you can watch over and over again. Although the movie is old, the jokes and the humor are still fresh and clever. A must"
AH0RSR1MUZDYE_11605,Not enough about basket ball and my daughter wanted a movie more about playing the game. I thought it was funny though
A2HHVMW1FKMOIQ_21890,"The movie had a few funny moments, but otherwise was a dud. There are much funnier movies out there.  Keep looking!"
A2X5WF3FPJ8C9J_18308,This DVD won't play at all on my DVD player.  I wish I could buy another copy that works.
A33Y0F2H65XL8Q_16392,"The movie is great. The streaming was pitiful. It took way too long to watch it, good thing I have 48 hours to view it."
AHL98CA2CJHQF_22695,Can't really review because I returned it.  It was boring and took it out of the DVD player.
ASK9UNL4ZM5RK_17451,They Ned a new writer to fill in the Tim e rather than having parked cars and trucks. Then to come up with an ending
A2PPPF06QVYQAW_12458,the best little whorehose in texas not in the  four feature films can some 1 help Ms.
A2UGWR1G654RK5_4233,"I really enjoyed watching this movie , and plan to watch it again soon! Anyone who likes movies , will
like it too."
A12Q2HBTMHNR1S_5757,We rented this so our teen daughter could watch and see what real movie making is like. This is just a great movie from the 80's. Loved it the first time I watched it and every time since...Thanks Amazon!!!
A21QX4ZXCEY1XY_14111,Good play. Not a great film. Jane Fonda was completely the wrong person. She just yells every line the same.
AQLUYZ2DWKCDQ_16298,It's Mr. Moto.  Peter Lorre plays Mr. Moto in this espionage mystery set near the outbreak of WWII.
A2K45DEJYK83ZB_253,"My seven year old grandson is really into SpongeBob, Sam and Cat, and Rabbit Invasion so I was shocked when this was the Christmas video he wanted to watch.  He thoroughly enjoyed it as did I."
A16AN42NMTL111_3931,What can one say about this classic movie Grandparent Parents Kids of all ages have seen this movie Jimmy Stewart in great and so was Donna Reed
A24GD68SY12QGZ_10751,"This is a really superlative introduction to very inexpensive Masonic (right) whorehouses in Jamaica.  Why, you'll feel just like a native sucker!!  WITH complementary ganja!"
A2RP2S43BN0ZB_9484,a good movie with some great stars. it contains dry British humor mixed with world war two subversive action by civilians.
A13N6P6XK7PT3A_8372,"I can watch this movie over and over again. I think my kids are sick of it after the 100th time watching it, but I am not"
A2SFUXVK5RP8VE_4496,what a wonderful and funny movie the actors are great it is a wonderful movie and would recommend it to anyone
A3O5T5VAQ3TD17_6921,"I love this film, It's one of those I watch over and over again. I find myself still laughing at some scenes."
A33WTFZCYRI97K_9876,Probably the weakest of the Indiana Jones movies but still and fun time. I would not hesitate to watch it again.
A32Y18WU5JG7KC_6698,This was an absolutely hilarious film with great acting from Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn. I would recommend this movie to anyone. I am so glad that I came across this one.
A1NULR6YJ9Y7QS_251,I love Christmas specials and try to watch all of them I can. This was great one for younger children or those of us who are young at heart!
A1ABKZ7MWWOWCZ_1795,I must have seen this movie 100 times by now. It is the reason I started fly fishing as a kid. Do yourself a favor and take 90 minutes to watch this gem!
A135NKWPQW8SAM_19638,This movie is Grade-B to say the least. The acting is just absolutely cheesy to the point that it makes you laugh. The theme does not deserve the money they spent on this film.
A3P38NOEKLR1ZA_12951,This movie was suited more to a younger age group but was interesting as sort of a prequel of Sherlock Holmes.
A2FHM6DSCFOABL_7225,Mr. Downey can be proud of this film. A fair and accurate depiction of Mr. Chaplin. So sad to see how poorly he was treated in this country by nuts like McCarthy and that queer Hoover.
A3LU9TPV885SLQ_1488,"We love these movies. I know its 2013 and we are just watching all the Resident Evil movies..lol
Its a time of Zombies!"
AHNDWVX0WCDXG_10106,I forced myself to sit through this thing knowing that Tom Ripley would  get caught and get his comeuppance in the end.  Got caught.  Didn't like  comeuppance.  What a waste of time!
A34OD5GD02R6KN_21860,"Good movie.  Special effects were nice, but the story was nice and the character actors did their work well."
AB31DNUB0FIGA_17266,"Sure it is watchable and Tommy Lee is a great actor but this film just didn't impress me that much.  Good, not great."
A2W75LE521OOTH_15945,"This is a great classic, something we usually try to watch around the holidays. It's comedy has faded just slightly over the years but still holds its own."
A35OWJ161BBKHG_19435,"This movie was shot at NMMI ,my old college. Nice to see the buildings and the post where I spent two years of my life ."
A1FGG830I2F9MS_22232,"Our Town was a show I remembered from high school but I couldn't
remember all about it.  It's good but slow compared to todays shows."
ALMFC0WLIYDCA_22223,"It was good to see, that other countries have the same sleazy politicians as we do!  This story did go a little over the top!"
A110YWKT0MDMXS_9281,Never tired of seeing this one and the sequel...we watch it about 2x per year.  Love these 2 guys together!
A1JYJA9GTTZZ8L_3633,Very funny! Was great to watch with my daughter and find the generational differences did not apply! We both loved it!
AIUDVB9CPTFBE_14087,Understated elegance and grace describe the cast and the flow of the story. Loren is beautiful as is Grant...two beautiful people. It helps to know that they had quite a relationship brewing behind the scenes.
A3K3C0B2O1LN9Y_11310,"I have to agree with those that have said that, given this is merely a different perspective toward the same book, it's an excellent movie.  I'm also a huge fan of the original movie series."
A1UNWUVI58VECE_3729,"This is a really good and interesting movie.  We really enjoyed this movie, it is worth watching! Enjoy this one!!"
A3Q2N9DO8SUFN7_16788,"it was okay for a women in prison flick. The plot was corny, but okay. The acting was substandard. The nudity was okay. The warden had an extremely weak personality as did the guards."
A20J3UBBHIECC_7063,"The first in the series to establish the awesomeness of John Rambo.  If you don't know, you better ask somebody!"
A1JAQWF2RDVJFJ_8951,A great performance by Pacino and several supporting actors tell this true story in an interesting fashion.  The end is not something you might expect from a non-fiction event.
A2YNRMO3M0Y1SQ_13571,"Great Robin Williams performance, and exceptionally apt and memorable portrayal of Olive Oil by Shelly Duval."
A3JQ9AKWBMGW1Z_22899,Not the best war  movie I have ever seen but was ok.  A little slow but the skipper was good.
A15FOD1E26MWT0_22694,"Not bad but a little disappointing...the actors were great, and there was some initial thrilling action, but about half way through, the movie started to fall apart somewhat."
AGFUQW3NI9YJS_15914,"A light heart, holiday themed tale of unique circumstances that keep pairing 2 odd, yet strangely connect people. Done by 2 great comedy legends."
A3PF3RTK53EEFX_13894,"Good comedy.  Not great.  But for a weekend movie with nothing else to do, it was good."
A3CE44SUJDTK34_21690,Biggest letdown in the history of cinema.  A few bright spots can't save this mess.
A1VCQE5NIBCKZT_14519,Old Amy movie. Lots of blanks shot off and today age poor quality.  The babes might like the skin. Pg rated that is.
A3GCPNR1ONJNH7_8916,"Was excellent, delivered before time and the quality is almost perfect. I recommend this movie any time."
A524B1PAO4WZA_2673,I needed to watch only five minutes of this film before vowing to hate it forever.
A2CUVE2OVDUT9X_22084,"Great film, good print EXCEPT no English subtitles!  Not helpful for the hearing impaired, unless they read Spanish or Japanese (!).  What were they thinking?"
A309SRXS2L8FGK_1630,I have already reviewed this movie as I have all that follow on the listing.  They are all good movies and received in great condition.  They make a good addition to my collection.  Thank you for very good service.
A1TNHX64CD7QC8_20245,"never like this movie, regardless of makeup Robin Williams still looks like Robin Williams. Gotta love the inflated prices for this blu-ray, nothing quite like cashing on on ones demise, huh?"
A305EHGTB1OGTA_23663,This was a gift for a beloved Aunt. I personally have no idea what the movie is about or whether it is good or not. She loves it and that's what counts.
A1FN1KW79R3KKE_5098,"It has everything: suspense, comedy, drama, and  one of the best scripts to be adapted from a fine novel.  Makes today's movies look sick by comparison.  Worth seeing over & over again!"
A2KJLFS4CD488H_1723,"Really good, squeaky clean, family movie. It can be a hard-knock life, but luckily we've got America's favorite orphan to cheer us up."
A2A9STR98ZVDLW_2783,I hadn't seen this movie in years and had forgotten how good is WASN'T.  It's no comparison to House Party 1!
A1T61QP7QHYBRQ_19537,"I thought this film was much better years ago, somehow I found it left a much more significant impression than when I watched it again so recently.

I guess my taste has changed and this is only my personal opinion."
AOVJYIUATQKR5_18598,"As a kid i loved this movie and was in awe of the special effects.  Still better than a Godzilla movie even today.  Rent it and see, my son liked it."
A2SIYUWT6H8B0G_22765,"I could only take a few minutes of this movie - it is simply so brainless that I could not take any more.  Don't bother, unless you like to watch girls portrayed as having no brains."
A11RWQ6BJGR3OJ_10211,My husband and I enjoy this film.  It's funny every time we watch it and we've seen it many times.  The DVD delivered is of excellent quality and allows selection of English or French captions.
A3UGN0MKIMI82U_12125,"This 1951 Western presentation has a decent plot .... but the poor DVD visual reproduction diminishes the
the overall quality of enjoyment, substantially."
A3GVGN07TO7Z7P_5157,I ordered this movie for my daughter who teaches 7th grade.  They've read the book and she's allowed them to view the movie.  I really appreciate Amazon's extensive movie selection.  They are a very handy teaching tool.  Great job Amazon.
A1ITV5WI7443T1_11170,"Supposedly a classic.
Downright awful movie..
Bad, bad, bad
O don't get it... maybe I missed that part of my education."
AIFBT8AN9RI53_14865,"""HUD"" is too ""down in life"" for ""Me"" to watch - even though the ""acting"" was fine!
The Old Mountain Goat"
AEM6KDMMY37BY_13757,It was quite scary for its time frame.  I saw it when I was little and never for got it.
A1B1ALTUOHEUPO_12327,This is a scary story about an ordinary man who gets into a real mess and can't get out of it.  Watch it for yourself to see what I mean.
A35GNQK1DC7WXU_7049,"First Blood, the Rambo 1 is a total classic from the early 80s!!!! This one is really raw with a brutal Rambo!!!! Highly Recommended!!!!"
A4DD23DXSM80K_17382,Waste of time and money. Need to drink before you watch this eyesore I have o idea what I was thinking
AHFHIGCWGNMU4_3006,"Fallen is an excellent movie. One of the greatest suspense thriller of all time. This movie deserves more than five stars. If you haven't seen it, buy it or rent."
A31E4CJ125XR9S_1004,"Visually a great LBX transfer, but sound is not well-balanced and there are NO EXTRAS..."
A390V0MQLXVPU9_20747,"Not as interesting as the original or part IV, but worth watching. The ending sets up #IV nicely."
A3AJSON8SXXBX5_4648,amistad is one great movie to watch anytime of the day with a great cast the blu-ray is excellent give this movie a 5 star.
A2MJHDD90EWV5C_2280,"They made this hysterical movie unavailable and I'm sure we all miss it greatly.
Next time it becomes available, I'm going to buy it!!!"
A3977ZXB1G0H08_13132,"While it's not a very realistic movie, and not one to use for educational purposes, it's very entertaining and I think it was Eddie Murphy's first movie, or close to it."
A3GUNOVVLMBXE6_21539,I love Johnny Depp.  But I should have known a movie about the world's worst movie maker couldn't be anything but equally as bad.
A309YQ01M3LCC8_18557,How could one go wrong with a cast that includes Kenneth Branagh and Emma Thompson? Just watch 5 or 10 minutes and find out. I've seen better Lifetime made for TV movies.
A1NBCH5SXMXZXW_4694,This film reminded me why Stallone was such a star. It made my 8 year old a Stallone fan!
A2L9FRUAT201F1_5944,This is a classic with a young Matthew McConaughey. Funny for anyone who went to high school in the 70s. My post-high school kids thought it was funny as well.
AJIXXLHUSOFC7_200,"Again I say, all Rankin-Bass shows are the best(IMHO) to watch at Christmas Time....
.....and Merry Christmas to everyone who reads this."
A2Y5Y3054ZCAVG_11502,"Indira Varma is so beautiful, sensual, the characters are so interesting.  I've seen it many times, and I still love to see this movie."
A10SOYI0EPLJGZ_11135,A new perspective on life can be a good thing. Just hard to leave the old life behind.
AHUJMR9UIKYJY_10124,Great documentary about World History. Actually first viewed this film in high school in an AP World History class
AF423MTRXJ9MC_8954,"I was disappointed in movie.
I thought that I had enjoyed on its original release, but I must have remembered incorrectly."
A1UHSTG0J1JNV5_5911,"Great action movie,  was amazed to find out that Clint Eastwood performed his own stunts. Good cast of supporting actors as well"
A3B50W72XI1XVT_22767,"It was okay, the reason I saw okay is because the cover is deceiving. I thought it was the 1991 Rodgers and Hammerstein collection, it actually turned out to be the 1997 version. so in the future always ask questions."
A3H3MXMX1O5KRP_8763,Nicely acted and directed modern take on an old Shirley Temple vehicle. The art production reproduced the era nicely and the actors portrayed their parts well.
A2S5XCW865NMT1_21555,"Pretty  good, but I'd have enjoyed it more if they covered something about his later life"
A36X0BZ0EVHYNX_19955,"Not the absolute best Welles, but very worthwhile and a good example of the genre."
A259VB9SZWDOAB_860,I love this movie!  I've seen it 100 times and plan on watching it 100 times more!  One of the best movies ever made!
A213Z796AMJOJN_18243,Didn't realize it was an import. Gave to my sis who has a player it works on.
A2I6SBUGP9RQ0U_21059,"The opening was great....lots of action, but then it switched scenes drastically and  I could not get passed the scene in the living room of one of the kids home."
A3C0DGHATPIAM1_22117,"I understand it is a classic suspense movie, but I just couldn't appreciate it for some reason.  I just watched Wages of Fear, really enjoyed that.  Oh well."
A188KEB7GV3NAZ_20105,"I would have liked to have more seasons available.  I did enjoy the shows that were before my visual memory, but I would love to see some later seasons as well."
ARYTHPMD4Q6FP_20372,It's no good to me if I can not play it in a US made DVD player !
A21MCMHHHIO3QT_18381,"AUDIO TRACKS ON THIS DVD ARE ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE,YOU CAN HEAR SOME OF THE ACTORS AND OTHERS YOU CAN'T........JUST TERRIBLE! I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS,BUT I HOPE WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE WILL DO A BETTER JOB IN THE FUTURE!!!"
A1VANK6OJIUJQ9_14061,"is a very tacky movie, but this s what we wanted then so it fit the bill. the lead in with jane was pretty good."
A3IJN9S0Y1RJXC_7410,I have enjoyed this movie periodically since it originally came out in the movie theaters. Highly recommended. A great movie.
A1GCIOKPZKFGWN_18812,"this movie is good gore-fest fun. there isn't much to the story, acting or dialogue, but it's fun watching people get eatened, especially the teen with his date in a car....too funny

it's worth a rental"
A1EM7JGORDT18W_9128,You have to put it into perspective that this was before a lot of the movies u see today. I'm sure the concept was revolutionary for its time as wells as the look and feel of the movie.
A1X9E3YRTX3UNU_3764,"Watch this, It Is a Wonderful Life. The cast created a memory to last for all time, perfect for any Jimmy Stewart or Donna Reed fan"
AMBB7P5YH78YO_12044,i have been looking for this movie for a while glad you had it available and at a great price too!
AFVUAOQIG4KWV_18227,"If you're looking for good music, then I suggest this movie.  If you're looking for an accurate story - STAY AWAY!  Almost NOTHING is factual!  I highly recommend ""De-Lovely"" for both accuracy and music."
A3HTAFZQBLXVXU_11472,I bought this video for my 2 year old who loves elmo... It has little to do with the true meaning of christmas and the plot becomes repetitive... Terrible dvd or video
A9IC3UW2VPJL7_3546,"I watch this every year and every year it makes me shed a few tears. The blu-ray remaster looks fantastic, plus the colorized version looks great and realistic! 5 stars, 10/10, Rick out of Morty! A must own!"
A3V1P580Y1HG6B_7348,"Arnie usually puts out good action flicks, but something went wrong here!  The story is decent.......but the action blows!  And when has Arnold ever needed a good plot?  Get T2."
A93TDYJZX5NMX_15800,Nice addition to the collection. Difficult to know who the bad guy is until the cliff. Entertaining throughout.
A19YBXY23A06XD_21519,A fairly good biography for the time that it was made.  After searching for her on the internet I found that the fact she died as a result of being alcoholic was glossed over.
A22OGA7RFTGJFL_5070,Gregory Peck as Atticus Finch is simply wonderful casting.  Read the book many years ago and picked the movie as a film class project and am glad that I finally got to watch it.
AY05Q0RHXOLHK_6971,Who wouldn't give 5 stars to this classic!  I watched it when it first came out and loved it then and love it still!
A3QWY875C163JR_16626,"This movie came out when I was just a kid.  It was
exciting and had great actors.  I just thought it
would be fun to own it and watch it again.  Adventure,
great acting and a good story."
A16JBOIW7LN2SZ_18937,"This movie isn't really for a true Bond enthusiast.  It has good direction and acting, but, it's just too silly to be considered a 007 movie.  The actresses are drop dead gorgeous for that time period."
AOT6RF81EMSNH_23594,"Good action.  If you like a story where the bad guys always lose, this is it."
A3KJBPJ0T0MNPS_11522,This is a good movie that had a lot of surprises around every corner. I am happy I added it to my collection
A3KWI13O0H0E7H_10238,A very interesting movie and I liked the overall concept. Even though you could guess how it was going to end you still watched it.
A1AA9SWMV7QQIJ_23206,"Beware!  Do NOT purchase anything produced by Cinema Archives.  The DVD did not work.  Neither did the DVD ""Down to the Sea in Ships"" or ""Stanley and Livingston""."
A3AA6CD30PAVA_22732,I wrote the Seller and Amazon because I was sent the wrong movie. I never received and answer from either one of them!
AIH35QDMJEJK0_1685,"It was a gift.  I can't personally say good or bad about it.  My friend  at age 92 thought it was the ""cat's pj's"" ..."
AWU110TP1HTPF_13858,"This film is a joke. Lon Chaney  and Boris Karloff are rolling over in their graves. If you're the simple minded, this film will probably delight you."
A1K107QA4B5SJT_21801,Enjoyable movie.  This is the second time we've watched it.  The best part is the Einstein and his 3 friends.
A1E7XH6WDYWAWK_11586,"GREAT! Just what I was looking for, Thank you. Would recommend to all who are in need of this item."
A2DFAQHW12ROWJ_13461,Liked this movie very much when it first came out and enjoyed watching it again.
A2NXLMNPSZ6P0_4005,"I just got the Blu-Ray version of this movie.  Everything is clearer, cleaner, and sharper than any version I'd seen before. Definitely worth the money, IMO."

A2DB6ORZPCFA9L_10801,Sorry I bought this...I was sure it was the original theatrical versions....but it is NOT. The promotion for this set is deceitful...not clear at all.
A1EV68RUVVW03F_18405,I have always loved Lucille Ball. But this movie was not one of her best. The story had great value about love and commitment. But the elements just didn't come together.
A1EWH82X8HFVT6_18402,Will smith's kid needs to learn had to act. his part made the movie horrible
A182736HYI8JHA_19217,A blast from the past which fulfilled a nostalgia need. Not heinous. I also have a soft spot for Stephanie because she is likable and I admired her father so much.
AEKFSQWWMMBCK_1965,"The Fisher King on VHS Arrived 2-4 days after I placed my order. Very Powerful movie w/ a very detailed story, probably have to watch it a second time, Great Movie!

R.I.P. Robin Williams: :("
AGX2K0FMS0IVL_18231,"I bought this on the recommendation of a friend who is real movie buff. The plot moves, but could use a big caffeine injection. Twenty minutes of the movie could be cut with no ill effect."
A28IG4A3F4OOWW_4263,Good classic movie.....VERY BAD dvd; used is the key word! Would not buy for this seller again. Beware!
A23Y4B63VROH7W_12210,"I saw this when it came out in theaters, so when I got the opportunity I added it to my library."
A3U0ER6TKM83C8_3164,"This is one of the classic Cary Grant films, I loved every minute of it.  I don't of anyone who hasn't  seen it and didn't love it."
A3G9CWG9V9AULA_14151,"I have almost everything Robert Redford has ever done, but I am still looking!!  A good movie with real-life issues, and a realistic ending. A great add to my collection!!!"
A1W8UXQGXEW9F5_22878,It was OK wish it was closer to the book. The ending was not like the book. It tried to make a happy ever after.
A2SPPMUL0GWI6V_2797,EVERYONE should watch this flick! Most all our current news are contrived. Highly recommend listening to Max Ratt podcasts for more insight: http://maxratt.com/blog/category/the-latest-from-max-ratt/
AUARIBZ7WJQXT_22937,A fairly good movie that enlists a scientist and his assistant to travel to the center of the earth only to have to save the local natives from giant bird like creatures
AAKZPL9AQ044E_2199,one of the greatest comedies (probably the best British comedy ever) and a must have for any movie collector
A3BOJNWO083WJS_15540,Am I mistaken? It looks as if this SuperDuperSpecialWhatever Edition is in Pan and scan. I can find no information on a widescreen version. Can anyone help?
A1GKH727RJA2Y3_5001,Bought this as a gift - the person is so thrilled it finally came out in Blu-ray.
A1160TNN7IPWEU_12265,"This was not a very good movie, nor well acted.  Anthony Quinn always play good movies but this one was just o.k."
A1Z79KWBZ3U9J4_8352,This movie pulled on my heart strings. You are rooting for Matt Damon. You can't help but too. Robin Williams is amazing!
AW6CPRPMF9ELC_21794,"I have mixed feeling about this. Acting was good.  After 1st half, it was hurried, characters not well developed and seemed to be authored by another person."
AY1PEC3Q5WCGR_10240,"Dull and it dragged.  The story did not ring true.  The plot was very predictable. I'm a big Brian Denahey fan, but this film was not a proper story for his talents."
A1Z47TYXHFKJIG_13984,"This is fun stuff. As a kid, I saw this in the theatre and the quality of the 3-D here measures up quite well. Well at least for me and I'm a confirmed film and horror fanatic."
A2I5DVQ4O1UYOU_10241,I rate this 1 1/2 stars; a terrible waste of time for two good actors.  I was very disappointed.
A1QFXPPUHEN141_3115,I love aviation history.  This is a great story of the development of a very valuable and essential WW2 weapon and told quite well.  The documentary after the film added value to the film.
A2KTPVK4T41ZCH_13631,Hey I only watched the opening scene which is hot.  I've seen it before and remember it being a good chick flick
A1K6C3AOX3V44H_13065,"loved the scenery, and if you have ever been to HAWAII, it will mean a little extra. good movie as well."
A35ZU8YPS3IY1J_14860,"This was a good film.  It is the first and older version but I still liked it. Creepy in some parts, kept my interest .I like Dustin Hoffman"
A28LLFIETK22WE_11106,Very interesting documentary about women and their influence in the years between the wars in Paris.
AXRXKN9SQP4OZ_13559,An old movie but fairly funny. Also hold attention because of the situation. I recommend it for an easy light-hearted evening.
A2EOUA9TIZDYMQ_7487,Still a wonderful movie after all these yrs. I was able to watch it with my children! Just wonderful
A17UI6ELPVIIJ_14796,This is a funny movie from the early '80s.  It has some great actors/actresses and a lot of laughs.  It's worth watching at least once.
A1BHWWL4LVF16Z_14092,"First, within in ten minutes I guessed ""who"" did it, so for a mystery, not so good. Second, let's hear it for mob justice and destroying one of the pillars of western civilization..."
A2LRIVIFZR8U3I_7045,"This is Classic John Rambo! The very first and one that started it all! But you knew that, didn't you!"
AKEMIQQLFR700_18066,As a child I loved this video - My 3 year old niece has watched it over and over.  It also teaches something about musical instruments and how music can tell a story.
A386W01ZVWMYC5_21329,"Already had this movie in Vhs, so I bought this when I had seen it was available in Blu Ray. Better picture quality. O.k.in the plot and action."
A2EB92T9PTCZ1L_23423,"Funny movie!! Watched it a very long time ago and just had to add it to my dvd collection. Funny, but too true in today's living."
A23GU293RUEHZJ_3749,"This is a very good product and I would recommend it to anyone, always shop at amazon to get the better price!"
A1G3P4BT2T9W2K_3249,"Slapstick vampire movie, might be just the thing to go with all the twilight shows."
A3M3I2AHCGQV7F_14096,"If you're a big fan of the ""cheesy"" 80's flicks.. pick this one up. It's really very funny! Pair it with a big pitcher of margaritas and you've got the recipe for a night of laughs."
A2A3NLKYM74RPC_19838,we like both other concerts much better than this one.  A lot more slow songs. just not as much 'fun' as the other two
A27SVLRMP4SCU2_16565,"Really enjoyed this movie.  Haven't seen it in years.  Just didn't care for nudity, but otherwise enjoyed movie.  Loved the ""old"" special effects."
A3PT1WF4F1TV3D_23833,Its amazing that they put crap like this a z movie on blu-ray and not Sci Fi Classics like The Thing From Another World and the 1953 War Of The Worlds.
A1Y8ZB71XUFQZ7_9663,"a classic. after 12 years since the last time, it still is a good love story"
A1GZHZ6CCYMG03_17385,A poorly written movie in my opinion. Brosnan wasted in this effort. Somehow the plot - meant to be clever - was only boring.  I was happy when it was over.
A29IPF6KF8D5YW_19575,"It was a good movie even though it was done many years ago.
As a free movie it was worth watching but I would not have paid even $1.99 to see it."
A11RWQ6BJGR3OJ_12481,Sissy Spacek does a great job singing like Loretta Lynn in this film.  All performances are excellent. We liked this movie so much that we bought a Loretta Lynn CD.
AEWUTG13NTNW_10655,You can't go wrong with Katherine Hepburn!  It was a good movie and I think I will watch the newer one with Patrick Stewart to see how that one compares to this one.
A3B6ZXQ7VUFRB3_17968,I couldn't buy the mother daughter relationship.  Maybe somebody younger than Meryl Streep in the role.  Had potential but didn't fulfill it in my opinion.  Not great but also not that bad.
A168X81I3TQKHT_19181,"This movie is very creative, but is very dark humor, best parts are like French miming"
AT1FHQCQBA64F_20744,"This was as the correct movie that I ordered, have seen this movie before and liked it, haven't opened this one to watch it just yet though. Just wanted to own it."
A2A3CI3XZHETIY_20457,"For some reason the five year old likes it.  However, none of the adults do, which is a bit surprising because I wouldn't think it would be something a child would like."
AENDBQC3I76ZO_9011,"I remain concerned about blade runner blu-ray. I thought I had more stuff coming. I read about a toy. A blade runner ""spinner car"" toy. I did not get it"
ALL502KWPMFP_4135,"Honestly if I could give it 2 1/2 stars that would feel more appropriate as the story line is just ok, but if you are an avid war films buff then you will probably like this well enough."
A2LPFSN9QTMPX_2152,"A must have for those who enjoy a good comedy. Plus, it's in steel book. What else could you ask for?"
A1PPW19WROG9KZ_4860,"I choose this rating cause it was the right choice nice product , Yes I would recommend this to all my friends THE SERVICE WAS GOOD THANKS AGAIN"
AZDQKWB7I53DG_19932,"While this is a good movie, it is a horrible DVD transfer.  It skips and jumps.  Wait for a better transfer."
A102J65ZAXNS14_10554,The Paths of Glory is a great old film of simpler time with good acting and a good story to tell.
A38RR1ZI6F2FL5_2647,"Great modern classic about how it feels to have to live as you force others to, or as the worm turns. I do want to give it away, a great movie!"
A3OPJR8O9P33WA_2408,"Well acted. Thought provoking. In the genre of the old ""Twilight Zone"" in which suspense is created without GCI graphics."
A1WNVH3AZJBU9E_14534,"Fabulous sets and costumes and scenery, ok acting,  story line ran a little shallow and kind of corny at times."
A3EVC62JMOHETW_16065,I've never been a big fan of Mr. Magoo but this is nicely done and less frightening for children than the live version.
A30DIBDCJUD4RK_3537,This is a classic. For years i always miss this movie during holidays. So i brought it... to God to be glory
A379IB3EYAEL5_22482,"We could only suffer through 20 minutes of this, finally DH asked do we really have to continue with this?  BORING."
APAJGIGTZB5L_13968,cheesy to great 3d. suspense is decent. First appearance of the hockey mask is awesome. characters are ok except Shelly who is so damn likable
AI362ECY8OD9C_13160,This is the only Clint Eastwood that is not Clint Eastwood but I own almost everything else!
AX9RMGFRIKKMZ_15695,"An entertaining, but definitely B- grade crime movie.  I guessed the ending, well before it happened.  I did like seeing some of the old cars in the movie."
A29QHLYBXQV5WQ_1993,Who could ask for more.  Robing Williams and Jeff Bridges.  2 excellent actors and a wonderful story with  a good supporting cast.
A1Y09QLADQYQJG_1020,"I REALLY liked this... but ya GOTTA have a warped sense-of-humor...
leaning more toward the HUMOR than the SENSE."
A3PQZS2NJ0ATXX_21080,"Reproduce this seminal horror classic in a US made, Blu-Ray, full length British version, in the correct aspect ratio and I will definitely buy it.
Until then, NO SALE."
A14ZAD178SZZMR_15009,This Anniversary edition arrived on time & in good condition. I enjoyed viewing this movie again & glad to know that I will have it in the future
A3TZADG4TN659V_9883,Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all-time and it was pointless! A 3rd class guy saves a 1st class young woman and they fall in love.
A267IXCC7UK1HY_17086,"Very entertaining.

The lesson of the movie is sound (husbands might just as well be faithful to their wives) but the plot is ingenious and the skits clever. The ending is surprising, and the whole experience is pleasant."
A1NXPD94C74PC0_21590,"It was good, but slow. I had never seen it all the way through and I am glad I did, but won't be one I buy."
A3OGCE7WLX8IA8_1420,this film is coming to blu-ray through the specialty label Twilight Time in December it was just announced. It will be limited to 3000 copies and sold online at Screen Archives website only.
A3I525SD0PL3GM_20155,Had to get this to go with all my other old movies. Wonder what other movies these actors are in.
A1RLSO6B5APQH4_7259,Very good action movies it kept u on the edge of your seat & the action was non-stop & very good story line
ATEQZBODEZWLN_16509,"Ted Danson is a fine actor and so likeable.  Loved these characters, great acting.  Easy to understand why Isabella Rossellini is considered such a great beauty."
A2TXAE30THSJSQ_14811,"I haven't seen this in a long time, but isn't this basically the same idea as the 1968 Lee Marvin/Toshiro Mifune war drama ""Hell in the Pacific?"""
A3NHYJ3Q0B1GZJ_3573,Grew up with this movie. Great to watch with the family and not just at certain times of the year.
AW3QSEHVDBIPQ_19453,I bought this for a friend and have not yet had the opportunity to watch it. We were both please at the speed and condition (new) it came in though.
A1VZ0SF3WGAHIY_16817,Gregory Peck and the cast are all very believable in this unusual story of the West. The ending is much different than most cowboy movies.
A2HK8T0U1XQBMZ_11863,This excellent documentary discusses the weakness and flaws of the Darwinian theory of evolution which leaves one to wonder who will devise the next theory to take into account these and other factors.
ATJN91PH28F6T_14689,"The film is alright, which is why I'm rating three stars, more because of the film rather than the shipping or the physical product."
A2Y072312WWMT5_15605,THIS WAS AVERY GOOD MOVIE I JUST WISH IT WAS IN COLOR. I WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE THAT HAS CHILDREN WATCH THIS MOVIE.
A5S3O0LJUVMZ3_2082,In box with plastic wrap and no peanuts that was a plus and everything was great and packaged well yay.
A1BRXFSDXBOQ7I_3724,Love this movie!  This is a classic that never gets old.  This is one of the first movies I always watch as Christmas approaches!
A21Q160EC78MVI_17238,A lighthouse keeper feeds a mysterious sea creature but it begins killing townspeople when he can't keep up with the creature's hunger. Fairly typical B grade 50's monster fest.
A3ETDHA42CEWO3_13794,this is an ok movie in my opinion. its not a masterpiece but its entertaining and keeps your interest till the end. I would recommend this.
A11MNKGD2VLZOB_4153,"Transfer was Excellent. Sound excellent.  Content Excellent.  If you liked the Right Stuff, I recommend this DVD."
A2IGT53A8JESJV_1717,"This Classic movie is up there with titles like ""Mary Poppins"", ""The sound of music"", ""It's a Wonderful Life""."
A2H3GUC6F6WKSM_8695,Interesting movie. Lots of stuff that most of us don't know about regarding the JFK assassination.
A3JJXSTSJS7A8M_5709,This movie still holds up as a fun and very entertaining movie. IT is a long time favorite. I can't believe we're not still kids....well at heart we are for sure!
A2URQRV364JKTF_517,Fun action movie with Ford as a believable President with a couple of slightly unbelievable scenes.  Great adventure and suspense.
A2RCEQLQA8TZRJ_10609,Very good old war movie (although there was no war scenes) with good acting and excellent plot. Only negative was being in black& white.
A2YTUSSQKJIZPK_19295,"I like this movie even though it is cheesy, but back then I only watched martial arts movies to see the fighting. Part 2 had even better fighting. It deserves a DVD remastered original format release at least."
A2X2AXKJHKAZNU_7796,Fun movie for the kids.  The only part I did not like was the ending when they were dancing around as a family.  That looked very hokey and contrived.  The story was fun and kids should like it a lot.
ABHBZLSS076Q6_11738,Bought because had never seen and was recommended.  I thought it was terrible but ended up giving it to someone who loved this as a child so everyone is happy.
A1IWYZ5EYTCBDR_486,My husband really likes special movies to fit the holiday. He really enjoyed the further truths and knowledge he gained from this movie.
AVUNLFCX4QVN1_4318,"This movie deserves 5 stars, anything short of that and the viewer wasn't paying attention."
A1BGDTZ2K0D08E_844,"This movie includes one of the best casts you could ever assemble.  No matter how many times I watch this, I cry buckets. The story is a beautiful tale of friendship, love, and sacrifice.  I highly recommend to everyone!"
A3RS23YCQGY6Q3_21661,"It was kind of slow. It had some interesting parts, but just pretty slow.  Julie Roberts was good as usual."
A5E5MB4GLMR2G_3602,"Everyone's favorite and love it every year!!!  Feeling blue during the year, put this on and there will be a smile on your face at the end."
A2COUU30N1DMAX_5717,"This is a great movie that I enjoyed a lot.  Good casting, good performances.  Plot with meaning.  One to watch."
A7QNYLKRE4LD1_8213,The cover is so awesome! I love the design. All discs and cover were perfect. I definitely got a great deal
A2KYEJHX24EF9B_22598,"the hunt.. was good , but this was more exciting to me.denzel is a great actor, and when it comes to being a black military officer, no one is better than he."
A33HNYRHVNEYKA_4259,A disappointing portrayal of a horrific battle. It failed to demonstrate the futility of the battle. The relationships were strained & false portrayal of military conduct.
A3C96IWQ26Q46I_4741,"Always liked this movie, finally got around to buying it.  Good quality, plays good, no complaints. Enjoyed seeing it again."
A7RN2QAWK3JET_9085,I think this movie is very boring and unimaginative. I thought there was a lot of unnecessary cruelty in the movie and lacked any merits as art or entertainment
A1IMO6SR37U67K_92,Every few Christmas seasons I watch this with my Mom.  The film makes us feel so good....it is well acted and never fails to leave a good feeling inside.
A1PIY2Z9PZBPR7_19529,I was intrigued by the title and also that Liam Neeson was in it.  It is a dark and depressing movie and I wondered why they made it.
A9O4L1EW36VBT_23382,these movies were not cleaned up or made into a good dvd format. Too bad it ruins my decision go further purchase and caution in further buying from ANYONE
A3V9GJ5LBZ8ZA1_22792,"It should not be placed under ""kids and family"" too much slicing and cutting etc. It is a scary kind of movie and more suited for older kids. Not recommended for kids under 9 years old."
A3FEYJ4CXJ8ILY_7634,"I saw Julia Roberts on an episode of Friends, so I watched this movie.  Not bad.  Good soundtrack, including 80s pop and smooth jazz.  Your usual love story, involving rags to riches, and star-crossed lovers.  She's a babe in here."
A3A1E05J5PXADW_7076,"quality could have been better - but overall, its fun to relive this movie now and again.  actually one of stallone's better movies outside of the Rocky franchise"
AVTY49Z9Q7DED_19214,Too stuffy and dry I like my shows to entertain and if I wanted to sit through all the scientific reasons something couldn't be true I would watch pbs.
A2BNCDK7AH5RCO_6788,"This is the type of movie you have to sit down and pay 100% ATTENTION to the plot, overwise, you will miss the entire plot. A GREAT MOVIE with GREAT  ACTORS!  Kevin Spacey is one of my favorite actors."
A2QUX0WLXLMHDV_18160,"Hey, I grew up in the 70s and enjoy a bit of farce but this was just painful.  Embarrassed to have bought."
A3AKM1G0N74UF4_23250,it was ok not great but Mr. van dyke is good on everything he does this film is no exception to the rule.
A2XDCYA8763WSY_6724,"This set may have been done the best, and you just can't find some of these rare films anymore."
A3EFBFA3KJD4G9_18500,"Although we are great fans of other British mysteries, this particular series just didn't hit the mark for us. Too old? Too much womanizing? Not sure where it comes from, but we returned this purchase to Amazon."
A3R8UUOKL55GCR_4126,"Deservedly renowned movie with stellar performances throughout, led of course by Daniel Day Lewis. Great chance to see the late Ray McNally's best work."
AITKYVDD9JJGL_7981,Enjoyed the movie and wanted to download on my Kindle Fire to re-watch.  No problems with the purchase or the download.
A3KZTEUNNB20OY_10928,"No one reads my reviews, so it doesn't matter what I write.  However, Amazon reviews serve nicely as a journal of what I read and watch."
AZ2TKV3HNK3N4_23704,Just ok a little dated not as good as i remember at all but still ok for a free watch
A2O29OBARQC1B6_699,"Wow, such a good chic flick. Have to have a box of tissues handy every time I watch it."
A2DRW895AM7LTD_19567,Bought this DVD because it was no longer available in stores and I had to do a scene from this movie that I needed to see how the original went.
A376GICDWTR6NX_20954,"Poor quality film. Lots of skips and breaks. That being said, although the film was incredibly racist, for the period it was the norm. All in all, not bad for the price"
A3FDGEQR295GBM_21027,"I had low expectations for a movie this old, and those expectations were certainly met!  The plot was obvious, and the special effects were bad - even for a movie of this vintage."
A3T4C9W2TWFCUP_23154,"Started not bad, then turned into a very stupid movie.....sorry I bought it based on previews. If I had seen this stuff prior, never would have got it, never mind wasting my time watching"
A3GOII95LRZE5A_21717,Has good values on being rich and shows that being greedy has a cost. Would recommend it for 6 and older.
A1ZZ2L3TKEH0BB_3003,one of those movies you have got to pay attention to what's going on. Excellent movie..
A84W0DOL0XMVU_14900,Purchased Gorgo for my 67 years old husband.  He really enjoys it I think it takes him back to his childhood years lol.
A1MNNPX52PEQU7_4002,I am very pleased with my dvd It's A Wonderful Life.  I especially like the bell ornament and the booklet is interesting.
A32DTCFBBB9WIV_6219,"Ok, when things are not going well, let's make a good old baseball movie to have good reviews and good cash coming in.. . This is the formula created by Costner, and it is working !"
A38H27891MU3AI_9040,I had to take off one star because it's the director's cut.  The major difference in the director's cut is at the very end of the movie.  Harrison Ford does not tell you what he's thinking.
ANY0OLDU3UAMK_13046,"Take a time back in time to another time and place, A group who wants to get home but has to fight there way to do it."
A12XNNJBG9H3CA_1984,"Although this video was made several years ago, my 5 and 7 year old grandchildren loved it. I also found it very entertaining and well done."
A3S18G7T4Q4CN6_11753,the DVD skips and brought this to the sellers attention- and i have heard nothing
A19DUD28C1UPS4_21129,"This movie I had to return because I didn't know that dvd's came in ""REGION"" form.  Well I ordered region 2 and we in the USA use ""REGION 1""  so I have to reorder in Region 1 form."
ACMXUXBZNTNRZ_17841,"Surprised that I did not enjoy it as much, the times they are a changing and I moved on. Nostalgic film but the smoking and overall vibe is over."
A2XW7MV6N7ZS5O_12036,I'll admit; I was first drawn to this film (at the age of nine) by the cutesy Sanrio characters.  Little did I expect the incredible animation that popped up in places-or the classic Pyramus-and-Thisbe storyline.
AEHRY7EPVUENW_22468,"Simply put, don't waste your time. Is there a mystery hidden in this morass? Who cares? Artsy-smartsy, pretentious meanderings through the oh-so-dark lives of vague, uninteresting characters who all brood way too much."
A1LJAZED0HGLSP_3255,Leslie Nielsen is funny to watch in whatever movie he plays in...oh and stop calling me Shirley.
AIXGXPHWTBGJL_11884,"Was interested in additional information concerning Isaiah; current times and the future.  Prepared using specific Scripture references.  Excellent reading, well done.  Thank you."
A245H7R33UX7P0_7736,"Funny And Romantic.
But The Ending Is Slight A Cliffhanger.
Because You Wanted To See More Of What's Going to Happened But It Already Ends.
But Overall A Very Good Rom-Com Film."
A4DTKC0QPXFQR_14571,"For the blu-ray transfer, at least this is not as bad as ""There's no business..."" One more time MM shows she was an actress, too bad she never realized this, or so biographers say."
A3DF3ET17R3QXW_14528,"One of Schwarzenegger's corniest best.  A must see if you are an Arnold fan.  Yet another film, that defined the 80's."
A16GCP4PJVDLDS_7119,"This is a great movie for your collection: Thriller, Suspense, Drama, some horror: Purchase it and you will love it"
A1BLOE8675070E_12141,"The worst Sherlock Holmes movie ever made!  Ridiculously melodramatic Holmes by Christopher Plummer and James Mason with a fatally disjointed plot and wooden, archaic acting by everyone involved."
AEQSPI1IHEG4O_1072,"Julia Roberts with a all star cast, this is a wonderful story of family trying to over come many problems off everyday life and then trying to come together as one family must buy."
A2VEQBYUS8YPE5_9166,enough is enough  stop ripping off customers how many times can one polish a film which was so much better than et...and yet we have seen it all before
A3BJ5TWHGD4SOP_13373,"Prime 1950's Sci Fi. Not as good as my all time favorite, This Island Earth but still fun. To a modern audience a lot of things will be seriously hokey. But that doesn't make it not fun."
A2AYA6Z6ARUCTA_20173,This is a good product. I would recommend this to anyone. I would be interested in more purchase like this one.
A365IJBFTYYGNJ_16034,Not a box office smash but a solid production with some very insightful story telling and dialogue.
A31UJGFDS7CDO1_3244,Product was delivered exactly as promised.  Leslie Nielsen is superb.  This is one of the funniest movies.  Enjoyed very much.
A2TBAUW2W7J538_21460,"I can't understand why people buy into the premillennial garbage? Anyone who can do any exegesis will be able to tell that every time Christ talks about the rapture, it is AFTER the tribulation."
A17LB6V4LE1IY5_23323,"I have both movies now. I had this one on VHS and wanted it on DVD, not a good copy but It is ok"
A2X2BW09SMFYA2_5063,"bought this for my grandsons for Christmas - we had many discussions about the book, film, author, cast and subject of film,
Great learning experience for them"
A242NHKVYIYHHP_19245,"Interesting who ""dun it"" with an eclectic cast. If you are a fan of James Gardner and his trademark laid back style and the quirky small (really small as in very inbred) towns this is right up your alley."
AL7BODXOVKG0Z_13733,Watched this with some friends last week.  It is tough when things you saw as a teenager are now retro!  The story line still holds up and the acting is good.  A vintage Michael Caine...when I like him the best!
A2Y897CK0F76VT_17701,"i read review that said it was good not really not much action
more talking"
A2WBB6L3XYKX5X_21970,"This movie plot isn't like some of the others he has made.  Also, if you want family friendly stuff, there is too much immodesty in this one."
A1GB7B0C1V2DBL_12157,It's ok - no big deal - it you are bored - it's a time waster
A101IGU6UDKW3X_14864,If the Great Outdoors and One Crazy Summer had a baby it would be Summer Rental. VERY inconsistent humor. John Candy is so lovable the film gets a ton of free passes but overall not terrible but not great either.
A1W7C0XL53PHM2_12735,I never watched this movie and no one else has excess to my account in my house !
A72HSMEOF7WUN_4445,"Great movie!  If anyone wants to see the little town it was filmed in, it was Loma, Nebraska.  You can still make out the Snyderville name painted on the exterior wall of the bar."
AM6NGG5YN4OXK_17614,Not really funny except the way people dressed. This was made right before cellphones came out so it feels strange
A3H5XFWSIZAT4U_7693,This is really a lot of fun. Light comedy at its best. Well acted and whimsical. You have to like it.
A3MUUCU2U9V8RN_3184,I'm just so thankful to find this wonderful movie on DVD and in such good condition and so affordable!
AGLN54GTQYW7E_3805,"Christopher Lambert, Sean Connery, and Clancy Brown in a classic about sword fighting immortals.

One of Clancy Brown's best characters to date (though, Mr. Crabs in SpongeBob ranks a close second)."
A1UO5QHH9HZ6X5_16142,it is an old one but I still think it is funny. Kids can watch it as well not sure if they would get what it is really about depending on the age of child. I would still recommend it.
A2VDL1W00E2V92_9973,I thought the picture quality could have been a bit better for Blu-ray.  I know it's an older movie but still.
A301SQTRZISCJ2_1219,another of my favorite movies what a great edition with all the extras thanks for getting it to me so quickly
A3SVYS054Q89YO_1485,I love the action in this film the story line is not so far fetched either! I never played the video game but the movie franchise is solid!!!
A1LEV4H5ZQ55J2_4580,"IF I'M WRONG I'LL APOLOGIZE, AFTER LEARNING HOW TO OBTAIN CLOSED CAPTIONED. My TV set has never failed to display CC or English Titles, but on this DVD it doesn't. There is no ""language"" set-up option."
A2DRVUMQB5S930_3823,The movie of course is great.  The Blu-ray is stunning.  The picture and audio are fantastic.  This is a great version.
A3EQBPDMK0IM4M_13379,This was a Cool Action Flick and Surprisingly it had a Good Story as well as a Cool Car Crash to.
A2XE1LZJ29WSCK_21274,"I loved this movie as a kid, but I'd not watch it now since I no longer believe in the idea of angels."
A3UQQUITIR9IMK_9902,"A typical John Wayne story, enjoyable but in some ways to obvious and easy to sense the end."
A3T4KD82YU49SR_15213,I would rather hear the CD of this movie then watch it. The concert scenes are good. But I didn't really care for the individual films of each of the four performers.
AGJU7DOKYEAAL_20820,"corny acting...some veteran actors through the movie, but not the ones that had ever played in any lead roles...the ones that play 30 second parts.  This is not very good at all."
AAGSCZD0BT5ZG_2071,I gave it to her.  She refuses to it.  She visited us for spring break and sang the entire show.  It was fabulous!
ASE6BWSH82W5B_21222,"Prof. Chomsky is always a compelling lecturer and interviewee. The footage in this video was unwatchable however, the Prof's talks were fascinating..."
A35GNQK1DC7WXU_7253,"Universal Soldier is a very good brutal action movie.....As other reviews say, this is BY FAR the best movie from Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren...."
AJT9NDFFCC5M9_19991,"I watched about a third of it and it just wasn't very interesting. Usually the supporting people are more interesting than the main, but not the case in this one. No one stood out."
A2O5MZXCP4RFSL_10748,Very disappointed. From the description I thought I was getting the version before lucas got hold of CGI.
AJZIS9MKUF7IB_18396,I am very glad to have the film but very disappointed that the extra making of features which were listed as include on this disk were not present.
A1WB47WJCS3NP4_20301,Definitely for older kids. I watched this with my 5 and 7 year old girls. None of us was really into it. Story line was ok.
A24WKOS7B5SLVA_820,I just love WEAZER!  This is one of my favorite movies and I remember watching it a lot with my mom.  I finally have a DVD of it and will always cherish it.  Just a great entertaining movie!
AUCQHARPNRMEV_15449,I threw it away. It just wasn't a good one like others I have had.
A36RQR0U0U83V1_7661,Sent this movie as a gift to 86-year old mother-in-law. Did not realize it was coming from Great Britain. Will not play in her DVD player. Different formatting?
A2ZUZLYCZMWBVH_22113,It was okay.  More nudity which surprised me somewhat.  But being in that time era was probably normal for island cultures.
A2FTQ90EWFATFC_3550,The color and clarity in this blu-ray is better then some other blue rays that are newer films. Stunning. The color makes the film pop. It comes alive. Beautiful.
A2P7D0LXAAVFZA_12172,Different story with great cast. I liked this because of the acting and the story. A good movie to watch on a cold night with an open mind.
A1L2DLWYRNHKDR_20923,Inspiring story with rare scenes of concentration camp Jews extracting vengeance from their SS oppressors. A major flaw: the acting on the part of many performers was mediocre enough to spoil the desired atmosphere.
A20S7XV2JK0UXL_12485,"The ""price was right"" & I bought (at a very good price too!) to add to my ""movie collection"" for those rainy days. (We need them too!)"
A3RRH6706FVML2_19154,Ok movie but superficial.  William holden is EXCELLANT...too young for Ginger Rogers.  One of his obligations to studio I assume.
A1T46ZX99UL07S_8590,"If you haven't seen Dirty Harry by now, you should watch it just to say you have."
A1ERFRG5DT2654_22031,This CD is terrible.  I hate the fact that when I was so excited to watch this DVD.  I put it in the DVD player and it says that it can't play in this region.
A3H4ADRRW3PQUC_22047,"I was a little disappointed because, though it was clever and the dialogue was good, it had long lapses in the action.  I'm glad. Only paid a few dollars to rent it on Amazon Prime."
A278WBES2T2BSZ_12077,Set decorations was well done. It felt like 1885 London and very well acted.  It lack a little in tension or drama. But a good show.
A1YOWQ54MXOCQ2_14902,I had forgot about this movie yet when I seen it it wasn't worth remembering
A2NUEM56R7AL6W_4049,"I didn't like this movie at all. I watched it all the way thru because I kept thinking that it was going to get better, based on the high reviews. It didn't. I give it Zero stars."
A1LNX4UXC0O7P0_17582,"I love this movie.  The DVD transfer was pretty poor, so I was looking forward to the Blu-ray version.  Unfortunately, it's only slightly better than the DVD."
A3NA19UPT1QIHD_8665,Haven't watched this movie in a while.  I am always interested in character portrayals by Jodie Foster.  She is what makes this movie enjoyable.
A30YL0GGBB8U7K_456,"It really does. OK, it was filmed forty years ago, so the odd wobbly wall etc., but if you don't fall in love with the well-written characters and evocation of Edwardian London you are not human."
A1QOVBJYTG9OFY_12929,The only thing was women's bear chest were shown. Never show men one eyed the movie is always funny. Good jokes
A3OPH5FCENKRH6_2959,"This movie is a very good leaning movie don't play with other people fillings you can get hurt playing with
Other people minds"
A1DWCV364HR156_11985,"No doubt, a good movie. However, my wife and I are avid action/adventure watchers and found the movie to be painfully slow. We didn't make it to the end."
A152MP888WYRYE_18262,"Far too slow moving.  Maybe it got better, but I stopped about half way through."
A1BFNBD9CPHHSW_13022,It is not a blockbuster but it does not offend your brain with crappy visuals. I would recommend it for families
A1KADC67YWWGIG_22098,"I wanted to see this because a Texas Ranger was in it.  It's ok, not spectacular.  Still enjoyed seeing it."
AXZPW8EEFRRX8_22161,I did enjoy watching Mel Gibson as a very young man but the plot was rather dumb and not something I would watch again.  To each its own.
A1RCDSN3GXHFC_7392,a must see movie. Katherine Hepburn and Henry Fonda were so good in this film
A3JNCR64IXN81L_4612,"Great Movie, Will Enjoy Watching it again and again, It's a new twist on an old fashion movie About finding peace with oneself and not forgetting who you are."
A3LYFRATW68EX1_2467,this one hit it out of the park. smooth and cool and sophisticated in many ways. i was immediately taken by the stark landscape of the future.
A3ER6S7Y1BOKM9_15346,"Two good stars, Harrison Ford and River Phoenix, as a man chases his dreams in the jungle."
A2LQ3ZMHIB41ZC_3773,This is a must-have in the collection; so I replaced a lost copy and this collector's set actually had things I hadn't seen before.
A2OA8TE8CGQCJO_11099,"We all laughed and thoroughly enjoyed this version of this story. It's a good addition to my library of Christmas Movies.
It was done really well...and a tribute to Jim Henson."
A2L8829SSFQZ6U_9671,its a good film.....I've always liked this movie...i gave it only 3 stars because its a funny cheeky movie....good acting funny but not an AWESOME content movie.
A30UTJUC9OLOQP_15789,"Much of the new liberation of the 60's was punctuated by distrust of institutions and a depressing fatalism.  With this video, I had a chance to relive that."
A32T2XLRS3XKOL_8420,"Unlike most reviewers, this movie did nothing for me.  It could not hold my attention even though I had intentions of liking it.  But I did not.  One of the worst Robin Williams movies I have seen."
AWBRZ9M5BASHQ_5391,The beginning at this movie is especially funny in my opinion. It is most certainly worth viewing. It is a classic that should be watched.
A3SC0U2708BPPP_8930,"Great movie directed by Clint Eastwood. Morgan Freeman was also awesome in this movie. The cast was just wonderful, wonderful"
A1XZ778T325O5M_16442,"Not bad as I recall, but not memorable as I had to review the synopsis to recall the movie after a few weeks. I recall some of the camera work was quite good."
A3SJ1262XLOW6P_17394,"Quirky, A Stand by Me sort of movie.
I would recommend it as a Popcorn movie.."
A1J0MN2RBPA8S8_11988,"When I think about 90's Indie films. This is one that always comes to mind. This is one of those stories that got told, for all the right reasons!"
A2BR12BYIGV1ER_23255,"Only thing that saves this is jay and silent bob, and the great stan lee!"
AU373JJVPGRD7_4330,"Interesting show that is a small part documentary and the main part a movie.  Good story line with circumstances that probably occurred way too often in battle.  Overall, a pretty good movie."
A35B2NPD61HL2X_6579,"Considering the rubbish that plays today and the CGI, soundstage spectacles that dominate filmmaking, Sorcerer is a breath of fresh air."
A37X6OXVPYXHMN_5755,"This movie never gets old.  I bought it so my teen boys could watch and we could discuss the stereotypes of high school, and how the more things change the more they stay the same."
A3CPTIL0S4RILK_13615,Classic Dragon movie! It was fun to watch with my daughter. Interesting to see Peter MacNicol earlier in his career.
ANPXMT8E4XKSL_10705,This movie was not very good. I only watched it because I was bored and there where no other movies I really wanted to see. This movie is probably good for a rainy day.
A1M3HAU7T3HTUC_9670,"I like this movie, worth it, i guess to get it on blu-ray. Nice to watch just to waste time."
A1XN6MBYDBTX16_2953,"This film is really a classic.  I highly recommend it.  It's a great romantic comedy.  I'd give it more stars if I could.
They don't make them like this anymore."
A2ZD3N1NZRYHXD_4306,"A brutal, sad, and unromantic film. One cannot ""like"" this, only admire the filmmaker and respect those who fought the battles."
A3GF9V3CNUN9M5_11955,I did not care for this movie. I thought it was quite depressing and sad. I watched it alone to preview for my kids and I did not even show it to them.
ADKKDZGDVEVWZ_18991,I love Bette Davis films and I did enjoy this one. Its not her best role but its certainly isn't her worst. Sometimes I think a movie just isn't directed in the way the writer really had it.
A3DS5AREACSS9F_1093,"The presentation (video and audio) is above passable and more than adequate for fans of the film.  Saw this in the theater, and it's comparable to what I saw; I remember it that well.  Recommended."
AIRTTW54COJ7N_14444,"I would recommend it, will buy again and again if necessary. Saw this movie along time ago and wanted to show to the family."
AHCPEI4NLGX0F_10123,"Not as funny as the original, but is still definitely worth watching.  Leslie never fails to deliver as the bumbling detective."
A2Q6JDDARML5CO_1291,This movie is a telling of how boredom and loneliness can drive a person insane. Watch it if you haven't already.
A2WWPVMDB1PS96_21179,This is NOT the full movie. Cuts off 2/3 of the way through so you don't know the ending. :(
A5JLAU2ARJ0BO_23859,With much excited anticipation I watched this on Netflix instant-play and man was it boring. There were some good scenes but overall the story was absolutely stupid and the visuals just didn't work out well for an anime.
A3QPI7X4QMNA1R_3183,"What  wonderful movie. Hardwicke, who plays Binky, was great, and the cameo by Leonard Nimoy made me fall out of my chair! Joan Fontaine--A+!!!"
AL9TBVIEZJUNW_20586,"Insipid, uninspired and Cary Grant is wasted in the role; not Jeanne Crain, though...you expect this kind of tripe with her in it."
A3SY4KO0I71HHO_4481,Purchased this item for my daughter. If there was a problem with it she would have let me know by now.
AVHMOENRENU3L_22310,I liked the beginning and thought it was funny but once they leave the hotel I thought it was boring and not funny. I was surprised it got nominated for an Oscar. Just not my type of movie.
A1N2B2BUQR9898_21600,"In my opinion, Mathau and Williams don't mix well. The plot is stodgy and slow moving even though Mathau tries, it just doesn't work."
A2VTDH5IVQBY4F_22208,"If it was a little more like the show and not a avant-garde sexual debauchery ride, then it could have been a little shorter."
A1HDAP6T69MIRS_8212,"The show is funny and the stereotyping is probably part of what makes it so funny, but it still bugs me."
A1NP7WCZ0IBPWN_20345,I think Martin and Lewis are funnier in some of their other films but for the price this is still a good one to have in the collection.
A2CHZEK4GBAOY6_6230,My wife and I love this movie. It never gets old no matter how many times you watch it. It is a classic!!!!
A1O8JBGRANCVEO_20860,The movie was way too long and I don't understand how this could have been nominated for an academy award.  Very overrated!
A56NHJDDU5G0T_7176,"This is one great movie that no one's heard of. It's got twists and turns with great acting and writing. If the paranormal is your bag, this is your flick!"
A1HHBC9J1TGB66_11544,"Meriel Hemingway is beautiful, sexy & charming in this.  This is an absolutely adorable and sexy movie.  Don't miss it."
A1BFE0O4SJQJ7X_19892,"Peter Cushing as always gives his best and here it shows but
  the movie has a lot of improvements that need to be made"
A3QB6MZT4R0ZWT_23765,"Fun movie to watch still despite how old it is. Young kids get scared during many parts of this, good to keep in mind."
AXC8K8KIH8CAB_9378,"follows the book, no surprises here.  Good rainy day movie, yes a chick flick.  Not a waste of your time but won't leave you wowed either.  Good supporting cast."
A1IUY4X0LO8CO6_16276,hey don't rent or buy quality is bad and not widescreen..  cheaper to buy it on DVD then on here..
A1FFTZZ08M80XO_19870,"classic B sci fi at it best and worst, some very long climbing scenes are a bit trying for patience, but fun anyway you look at it."
A1Z6AFVIC6V20L_1607,"Great cinema.  A miraculous story (I read the book, which is a marvel!!) told most poignantly and insightfully.  Not to be missed!"
A1OM1HSFAA4VIR_22472,"Basically a Karate move with monsters made by the guys who brought us ""Re-Animator"", so the overacting is obvious and the gross monster effects are amusing if not a bit silly."
A3BP8TWTIMD3MZ_22755,"This movie was just fair. Alicia Silverstone wasn't that convincing.  I did like Brittany Murphy's performance, though."
AJXJ6YZ2695G2_265,My mom bought this about 6 weeks ago and has shown significant improvement in bladder control.  She convince me to buy it and now I'm getting results myself.
A13Z0WIZ32IV1U_8994,"Thought it would get me motivated to see the new version, it had the opposite effect."
AZSLVAXI8R3Z5_23631,"Not very exciting, quite old movie, but interesting for those who lived in the 60's."
AY4KQLB5ZCDYM_21568,"Sorry but this was lost in facts. Story about. Stanwyck's  love long lost relationship with Clifton Webb. Recommend a ""night to remember"" instead."
A1Y6LNDCUWPHN2_718,"Great Movie, but the product description says Language: English (Dolby Digital 5.1), and its not. Its only Dolby 2 channel, not 5.1."
AFYGEH2X46ZLG_9674,"The story lines have gotten better in this season and it is fun to watch, but I still like Voyager better of the spin offs."
A2K6VS9NMZH9OG_9695,"In this season the characters become a little more developed. You progress Sisko's story as the profit, Worf's relationship with Dax, and a big secret about Doctor Bashir is revealed. A lot of things this season set up future episodes."
A32YL4WWI1FJFF_18835,"AWFUL QUALITY! LOOKS OFFICIAL BUT IT IS NOT!
Absolutely terrible quality. DVDs from 20 years ago look better.
STAY AWAY!"
A1L2DLWYRNHKDR_11762,"Interesting, but not particularly enlightening of the gliders' role in WWII. Too ""chopped up"" a narrative for providing a comprehensive view of their advantages and limitations."
A37UJC4OCZCKCL_18740,It was one of my great favorites as a boy. It's not that any more but it was great fun seeing it again!
A26K9L145E00Y8_12496,Has found me receiving many of my BLU-RAY discs with a shattered corner or cracked jacket. The movie itself is a classic!!
A1LEHG598450OQ_7772,"Awesome great movie to watch,  watched several times  and loved it.  Love watching on my IPAD  with ear buds so people will not know what I'm reading lol."
A33KMI9T4QFEE0_3494,Daughter asked for this movie so I ordered it for her since she said it was a good movie and would like to have it. The delivery was fast and item was in good condition.
A3UVDRFQ1QCKM3_15833,"Never got to view it, wouldn't play on my DVD player, but the seller made good. All is well, though I got to find a copy I can watch."
AX6GG8U1HDSZZ_12605,"Somewhat incomprehensible motivations of some of the characters, many of whom are simply mono-dimensional cutouts of standard ""types"", but for a comic-book western, it's not too bad."
A10175AMUHOQC4_6527,liked this movie a lot Robert Downey Jr. really did a great job playing a serial killer in and out of dreams
A1F77J0NFZJXP_9899,A little unbelievable (or does this really happen in those middle of no where 0.5 horse towns?) but very entertaining.
A2XBQCUTYOL61G_14969,"A film about the making of a film, but really not self-referential. Solid filmmaking, excellent performances all round. Well rec'd in its time, under-rated now."
A3MTPTQPOFG84V_8195,Another awesome old Disney movie that my girls love! I like the fact that it has a lot of special features that talk about the making of the movie and why it was such an achievement when it was made.
A23BOYR1THDQR6_22620,Fun...good to see Ralph Fiennes in a humorous role.. He's gifted!!..  Kinda vaudeville atmosphere...Once around the story line is enough.
A1E28DQ8UZQFSJ_13903,Good cast.  Good photography.  Good story.  I have enjoyed this movie several times since it came out.  It never seems to get old.
AH6DEGR6YXT0F_20936,"Since the circumstances cannot be reproduced on even a minimal level, this is a difficult movie to make. The director did the best that he/she could do."
A1HFMQDAA2SC1W_9802,"Watching John Wayne, the draft dodger, act in these war movies has always turned my stomach. The movie itself is quite good and holds up pretty well. The supporting cast is excellent and they carry the movie."
A55DWAFXRTZXG_19253,o well it was the best you can do . the sound is with static and with  all my effort to clean it . well that the best i can do . ART
A3RCZ458VHLNAJ_11323,"Great fifties movie. The giant grasshoppers are not as frightening as other ""big bugs"" in the movies.  Peter Graves is always enjoyable to watch.  Too bad it wasn't in color."
A2ZKJFL7OMCVGY_14474,"For an old movie it was ok. Kinda hard to watch it. It was more like Hogans heroes, the show in the 60s"
AIYHTH4UDEYNU_2420,"Loved it and have watched it numerous times. Provocative, thoughtful, mysterious, entertaining. When I can't find my own copy, I rent it because truly intelligent films are a rarity."
A22EB7ZS5YZXLD_5176,One of the greatest comedies ever made. Almost every line is quotable. So much so that I use quotes from this movie in daily conversation on accident.
A125MB4R88JZ5U_17910,"This movie about newlyweds buying a trailer and nearly splitting up because of it.  It has some laughs, but I had hoped for a funnier and higher quality movie."
AKEBOW1GLXLHG_22203,"Well acted movie that struggles to make its point,  Lacks character development of the main protagonists. Doom and gloom are the overriding themes. One is left to assume that life goes wrong for anyone of Russian extraction in Brooklyn"
A2T06ZT4ZQAQJO_9425,Well done scary movie which was a modern remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
A1PX7AMTWN2PN9_15245,WELL DONE MOVIE--MANY MAJOR STARS IN THE CAST--GOOD STORYLINE--WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO MOST OF MY  FRIENDS--ANY THAT LIKE ACTION--WWII MATERIAL --OR GOOD DRAMA
AVDUZMUU6LO0W_307,"great, clean 4 the whole family. any adult that liked the old pink panther movies will like this as well."
A2VSO0D892M3UN_21851,I could not enjoy this movie due to no closed caption for the hearing impaired. okay for those whom can hear probably.
A3CZS2QBOYKJ55_8366,can't even buy a movie  from the Android app.  this is complete garbage.  i hope they find a fix to this failure.
A5KKASK7J5YSQ_15059,the classic from the 40's a family watch classic music dance love story and good deeds abound in this bing cosby fav
A2A7WFFEFIBJ35_8322,They restored this movie quite well. Hope my children enjoy it as much as I did when I was little. Nothing major special features-wise
AHPOI257FW6AV_20902,read the reviews with this dvd and you think you will be getting a 4 dvd set with 26 episodes and the old serial.....but no .... I got a 1 dvd movie made up of a few episodes ......really disappointing!!!!
A1A1Z5K3Q9YUHW_15110,"couldn't get any english audio on blu-ray so I've return it, But the movie itself is a great movie"
AE4WX4JV3USWI_7608,"This is an awesome movie! A must see for all kids these days! Kids need to get outside and learn of their surroundings, try to experience the outdoors! This movie might inspire them!"
A26NBBI9OCEATY_4689,Trapped in a tunnel with fire at both ends.  YIKES!  Got a little claustrophobic.  Great ending!
A3ZQKCI4TFNXA_19108,"PACKAGED WELL, CAME ON TIME. HAD NO PROBLEMS WITH THIS ITEM. NO DAMAGE AT ALL, OLDER MOVIE, BUT IN GOOD CONDITION"
A1G1OHLT5E8QMM_16307,"Arguably the worst Godzilla film ever. The monster fight scenes were terrible, the plot awful and those rubber monster costumes were a joke. This is one Godzilla movie I missed growing up. It turns out I didn't miss anything."
A11YB81ZV7R7JH_7891,"I bet I've watched this 100 times with my grandchildren and grand nieces! This is my 4th purchase because I love it as much as they do!
Now we all have a copy!"
A30MB5NYX14658_22384,Godzilla vs King Kong most of the movie is rather lame the men in suits is corny but its fun to watch once you get past those limits of this movie.
A3CGHACA377KS_20306,Stakeout was a five star and this is a bomb. Rosie O'Donnell seems to added for a name and she is horrible. I bought the video and sold it to a pawnshop immediately.
A3DBVVCB78CJLP_23515,Thoroughly unpleasant movie to watch purporting to explore sadistic aspects of love -- along the lines of Boxcar Bertha. Sorry I wasted $2.99 renting it.
A2MG8HX7BS374N_19971,I was disappointed.  I purchased it because Robin Williams was in it.  I am surprised that he would agree to be in it.
A210GGI9IB8N0A_2587,Daniel Day Lewis is superb in this engaging movie. He has a face of a thousand nuanced expressions. Loved it!
A4K86OFPKKUGW_5736,We just got a Blu Ray player and were wanting to start collecting some of our favs onto Blu Ray. Love this Movie!!
A246D56KFO5CG_5570,One of the greatest movies ever made and the soundtrack is worth the price alone.
ACLJMDL6TS0NO_5900,One of the only spy drama's Client Eastwood was in. I wish he had done more because this is one of my absolute favorite Client Eastwood movies.
A2N03TUL3EZZDD_22341,i didn't find allot to like about this other than the brief action scenes. i didn't find it very fun but i kind of like it.
A2O0SB673X76OS_23204,"Apparently Yul Brenner's first movie.  It is a pretty good story, but the video quality was poor."
ALE6Q77QHL1MU_13502,"I JUST COULDN'T GET INTO THIS MOVIE.  TIMES HAVE CHANGED TOO MUCH SINCE THIS MOVIE WAS MADE,"
A2O68SQKF0W8A3_17405,"Holy C-movie, Batman.  That was horrendous.  I don't even know where to start.  I'm just going to call my therapist and try to wipe this from my memory."
A2EDRNKOWF8FQI_8001,I loved this movie as much as my daughter did!  We saw it a couple of times in the theater and had to buy it the day it came out on DVD.
AIKXESYKV13OT_4770,"This is a wonderful movie, and I highly recommend purchasing this dvd. It was well packaged and in great condition, and it arrived in a timely fashion. One of the best classic movies ever made."
A2ROHH6HN45ZYA_14112,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Barbarella-Queen-of-the-Galaxy/dp/B00000IREA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Barbarella: Queen of the Galaxy</a>A great period piece that is (unintentionally?) funny. A cross between soft core porn and early Star Trek"
A35E9F3NJG6LH4_12282,When this movie originally came out it was edgy.  I guess time has diminished some of the tension.  It's still a reminder that there are weirdos on the road who can cause havoc.  Beware!
A1XBYO8YP5AFHD_11746,"This charming little Muppetry production has been a holiday favorite for me since it first appeared on HBO years ago.

Some people don't get it, but some people don't get Frosty and Rudolph either."
A2SOP8A6JAVMP3_9613,"This was an unusual story, very interesting. May be too sexual, or scary for some people. Really enjoyed the performances of the actors."
A254EBBW0W3SOW_1838,"Classic, who doesn't like Annie! My 5 year old watched it and he was singing all the songs for the next 3 days! Good, clean, child friendly movie!"
A1FZ5LYHDOI68Q_10629,this was good only because i could get a double feature of my favorite 70's movies that i can add to my collection
ABENDGC09XPUF_1507,Really funny 80's movie and great take on a classic.  Some language may be inappropriate for kids though
A2CNXXVWOAPE0B_948,"Loved it when it originally came out, loved it even more now.  The extras were fascinating.  Holds up very well after 30+ years."
AEZEHPJAQGDJC_9812,The movie is slow moving and very long. John Wayne is good in any movie and this is no exception. The plot isn't very deep and the outcome is easy to figure out.
AJVBF0LOFCB12_22741,"Too hipsterish for its own good.  I couldn't take any more patterns or quirkiness, it was nauseatingly slick & smart."
A2XWS9EWB45W79_5451,"I absolutely love this movie, and am so glad I bought it! It is hilarious! The movie was in perfect condition when I received it."
A2CA7DH5B7Y5XN_14538,"Don't have to try right away the Blu-ray, I hope it's not a Chinese copy... You know what I mean..."
A2F2DC7KL40QWI_3293,"Love the theme of this movie, though really small kids may get scared by some scenes."
A44IQKDRQZN0L_20766,"This was a highly underrated Duke film.  However, it had most of the best elements of John Wayne."
AQ5SQANROVEET_3225,"Very funny classic, easily worth the rent if you have never seen it... or just to see it again!"
A1QRR06UY3LI9G_14220,"This is not as good as other G.C. Scott movies I could recommend, such as ""The Hospital"" or ""Rage"" , but it is a satisfactory family type story."
A27DSB3LM9YKAG_2961,I purchased this DVD because I really enjoy Martin Lawrence! I think that he is an all around actor! The music on this DVD is outstanding! Your money will be well spent!
A3H2QCZO4SK3XL_23088,"The recording of film is extremely poor. Its hard to make out the people, makes me thing twice before ordering again."
A2WRTIPLJJXMQ0_9416,"I liked this story, since I read the novel when I was in Junior high.  Robert Mitchum is an under rated actor."
A18ZICRPASG656_22426,"Price for the movies was great, but durability of the box is terrible.  Inside mounts came broken and loose."
A58E5ZXMGEWL4_20681,"I did not have the pleasure of watching this movie, although it is one of my favorites. I did not own a blu-ray at the time, and gave it away to a friend for his kids."
A3G09BPX8PLAFC_7692,"Two actors who work well together, This is a great movie to watch with someone"
A36X607D43CYU_2242,Enjoyable for all! This is a fun story of Elmo's blankie.  My son loves his blankie so this movie was great fun!
A5JPZOCEN9AX0_20232,"Better than the First Class movie, it is a nice solution for bringing in other characters and defining the Xmen."
A2776MNKECT4VB_1176,We ordered them all and watched them after they all came in. It came in on time so that's always a big plus to me.
A1LNEPQV8CTELK_17728,Not as scary as I remembered it to be however good to have in a collection. Ingrid Bergman as always is wonderful.
A1ZTNK1CNTQ952_15989,A good movie but I didn't think it was quite as good as James Dean's other 2 movies
A1SCDNLCN9SOR9_20538,Definitely not the right source material for network television. Watered down Stephen King pablum for prime time and where are the cowbells?
A21P4XMS67A09G_10376,great musical.  it's about a flying car that takes them on many adventures.  awesome songs.  great to keep kids entertained for hours
A2BQQXNKIDPWXZ_12452,The music from Tchaikovsky was fantastic and ballet dancers were very good. The costuming could have been better and the amount of movement should have been much greater than it was.
A2TL6S3TCM8YM_17485,"bought this knowing it was French, but I thought it had English subtitles at least.  It does not.  Oh well, still I have it anyways!"
AMYJOS6JQFSW7_22097,"Just not my style - I know lots of folks who loved it, but it was just too strange for my taste."
A1PRPHWG22CKKG_10766,"What to say; a classic. Good packaging although there is not much behind the standard content. The movies are the re-mastered version, so you may want to look elsewhere for the untouched theatrical version,"
AO4ZG16RR30OM_2631,"We really enjoyed this movie. Had heard a lot about it and were not disappointed. Glad we ordered it. Arrived on time and packed well. Classic Newman and a classic tale of revenge, done well."
A1S2ZHOASKTQO8_21293,"Saw this movie years ago and decided to get it on DVD. Fun movie with plenty of action. Rutger had plenty of potential when he started, but his potential never really blossomed."
A3JLOIXFM75QNV_13024,"This movie grated on my nerves at times, but for the most part, I liked it and found it moving. If you like a good cry, watch this film."
A2B19K5WQK4FDQ_22698,"There was a lot of 90s hair and I loved the old cars. Mostly high camp, acting - college drama department levels"
AWZ0II2EHIQ36_20422,But my daughter liked it and she would watch it again and again. Reminded me of something from when I was a kid!
AYFYP9PBOCMRE_11093,Great interpretation that stays with the original while bringing a smile and a tear yo your face. Love it! Rare.
AXTI2E8OVWQ6T_8684,I thought I bought the DVD and only opened the case recently from February.....threw it away .  I think you should be more specific...about what you are selling.....
A7MD5CNQ9EDH6_15384,"Paul Newman is always so relaxed in his acting that you forget him and see only the character he plays. This is not his best performance or movie, but still a movie to be owned by true Newman fans."
A2NNFF53IKLASW_2451,I had to watch it twice to get the dialogue and the general idea. I think it's worth a free watch. Tom's acting kept me interested.
A2ZMGIE78SAVD4_5058,"A ""must see"" for all.  The story, characters, and of course the actors espec. Gregory Peck ....entertaining w/ humor, dealing w/ issues that are still relevant in today's ""digital age"" .."
A14Q21WV7FGKZ0_21455,"Got this DVD & it was a great buy. Well recommend it ,great story line & not over done. Awesome."
A3RPFXD8A1DYWK_13434,Good slap stick comedy with Peter Graves and other Actors of the late 70's. HD did not improve the quality of the Picture but streaming does.
A1QMIY6O7VV5XD_4723,nice blu-ray reproduction. there were times I could definitely tell the difference from original dvd quality. add this to your stall one arsenal
A2ZK0GYZXYWBWL_502,"Unmistakably, one of General Washington's finest moments, this story is portrayed extremely well by Jeff Daniels and the rest of the cast. Well done!"
A1P0VW7IXUNUM2_14972,"ok movie but a bit boring...jacqueline ok but not a fav...french movie product docu drama of sources but not that informative
there's not action here pace slow not for most american viewers"
A3L12JIZ9T13TP_17234,"I have always loved this film, but ... I tried to watch this twice.  the picture quality was the worse. Wish I could take it back."
A32R3H0YLLYKTG_3267,Kids love it adults too if you like him.. Typical  Leslie nielson toung in cheek humor .Always fun to watch him in action.
A23QY2GBOS2GF5_14427,"This didn't live up to my expectations nor the rating that was listed with it.  It was far beneath the first one, Romancing the Stone."
A6UYDCUQU0AC9_3288,"Ya got to love Scooby & Shaggy!
My 8 year old son and I have watched this several times and always get a kick out of it!"
A17F3JQAMH2L1U_10878,This is an ok movie. Fun to watch but not one I will watch all the time.
A2VFK53ICBGTS_19339,"Do not get this one. The quality - well, there are none!! grainy and pixcelates terrible. need to be recalled in my opinion!!"
A2XG9D9LW2FOXC_16459,"Melanie was to fat to watch and her acting was horrific, although Sting was great in a very BAD movie."
A1K4VAYQQLNFVS_23240,A so unreal plot with senseless flashbacks. But Mimi Roger's bod rules -- no question about it. Don't bother about her acting (or lack thereof). Anybody who's interested in mature ladies' beauty just can't miss this one.
AXBEA9865Q9Y5_1213,"While this film came out a few months before Top Gun, it was a hit when it was showcased. Then, Top Gun quickly eclipsed it. With a great '80s soundtrack, it is time to give this flying movie another pass."
A2GU23OA3KRV4_16230,"It is a really good movie, but then I really like John Wayne ""the Duke""."
A7WYKULM3LTA0_4984,What can I say....a classic. One of these days I'll read the book for unanswered questions
A34OD5GD02R6KN_21365,"Nice to see clean, family movies that still believe in family values and show it in a nice movie setting for the whole family to watch and enjoy."
A1VAU4V7HOE90T_21747,"It was fun to watch, but my memory was a little fuzzy on the film.  It is entertaining, but don't expect much on the quality of the film  Too bad."
A17L3A7R1BWE8P_12651,A classic 80's sci-fi comedy. More for adults than for young children. One of those cult classic's.
A1AO356OQSF48R_12492,A fine addition to the Universal Films collection. The old stars doing what they do best.
APAHG7NMDGJVD_23739,a nice movie for a cold rainy day when you'd like to do nothing but drift and sleep. Excellent for sick days off the clock
A2XSH9T0F40JVW_10426,"De Niro is reliable as always, but his love interest in the female lead seems implausible. The cast is great and this film has plenty of thrills to keep you entertained."
A2LJFBPNTI0WFR_1430,still the only re movie i enjoy seeing. like half of 2  half of 3 and that's about it. I'm planning to go see final chapter on opening day.
A27E1191RPOR17_13460,"Cheesy and cliched, but original characters were exactly that. ""Damn it Jim, I'm just
a doctor"". Fun to relive tv crew, but not a great film."
A36JN7CKOPEQAF_7653,"and would recommend this classic to anyone.........Everyone knows the story well, and we all hate that he has to kill the dog when he catches rabies.........:0(  very sad...........Bought this so that the grandchildren will have it to see........."
A1JKMVZ42W6N8L_12549,Of course it wasn't as suspenseful as the first time I watched it. I still enjoyed it. This was so different for her and she did a great job!
A228G42GUX78TZ_18736,"Relatively interesting and suspenseful. Melanie Griffith was hard to understand, like she was whispering to someone."
A3TE0D3497ND2N_7825,Love Amy Adams and she did an excellent job here.  However the actual story was silly and boring.
A2ZP9TI8QWTH4G_6181,Love this movie. Been looking for it on DVD in the stores. Decided to try the internet. Amazon had this movie plus other ones that I have been looking for.
A5HBE9HVP1RX_10544,"I loved this movie when I was a little boy and I love it even more now that I have family of my own.  No only does it provide laughs, but also demonstrates the insanity of assumed gender roles."
AJXUZA0Q91HON_14920,"The Brits couldn't abide the Japanese having the world's only gigantic prehistoric two legged dinosaur destroying it's cities, so they dredged up one of their own.  Jolly good show!"
ADW33RCLBRPZL_12360,One of my favs from the 80s... and Ms. Kinski's in it so its a definite must-have for my movie collection!! This Blu-ray transfer is near excellent!!!!
AGV269NMIVLH5_17807,"I'm at a loss, why did Warner Archives give the job of remastering this Blu-ray to the guy delivering Pizza. Shockingly bad! Buy the DVD it's much better!"
A21ODN5KJ07S2V_18085,the movie sucks i did not have the European version like it told you it did that why i bought it in the first place
AYLMM5ZTJJP9W_10893,"Certainly an interesting movie.  Had never seen it, but so many people I knew had.  It is worth watching at least once."
A7Y6AVS576M03_11309,Looking at this film objectively and trying not to make any comparisons to the original I found it to be just average filmmaking. The story and character development is very minimal. The denouement is just ridiculous.
A1L46PC7ND70T9_15870,"I had forgotten how stupid these movies were.  Guess when I first saw them I had nothing to compare them to, and I remembered them as scary and fun.  But not so much by today's standards."
A2S7M60023E8V9_17648,Outstanding visually but not as moving as the master's earlier works but still it's Kurosawa so it's worth a look!
A2T3MIRPC0LJFF_14632,Thank you.  This is my favorite and I will do business with you again.  Hope you have a nice summer
A1GVGV4EJ3X1BZ_4869,"One of the best movies ever made, based on one of the best books ever written."
A1ENSYH5GQ28PC_16044,THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR THE USE IN THE U.S.A. DO NOT BUY IT ! i did not see where it said  it was not for this region until i put it into the dvd player
A189518U6ZC08I_21624,Saw it on TV when it first came out. Cheap sets and bad acting. Was much better when I was 11 years old.
A3EIH7QQW7Y9SS_19002,"Although its still kind of cheesy - I mean, its a Roger Moore film - its not as bad as so many of his other outings as Bond.  Nowhere near as bad as Moonraker, for example."
A1L4NEIE8K2MCW_19232,The suspense ended 25% into the movie. It was an obvious who dunit with very little left to the imagination.
A2UYKZHBTHPFVG_9783,"Seen it on DVD before, blu-ray is amazing with crisp picture and sound, be sure to have good av receiver to get the best effects."
A1CAA4DOATVCWW_9268,"cute
funny
silly
thought it was jealousy riddled
nice that the children got together in the end...
good to see ice fishing again"
A370EYV6NOCKCF_84,I have searched for this film for years and finally found it here on Amazon. Saw it on television years ago and it was one I knew I wanted.
A128VU9LPD7FEH_8754,Although it doesn't totally follow the story in the book it is an excellent movie. I really enjoyed this movie.
A2OPE81Q4NAFYH_16637,No matter how many times I watch this movie it always stirs the excitement and adventure centers I the brain.  Great photography and story without needless violence and foul language.  Worth viewing more than once
A334VXUGQJWNOQ_11137,"This is a good classic movie. I like John Cussack, so most of his movies are winners with me. It is a good snuggled with the wife movie."
A1XRPOP6G5U537_13596,"I loved this movie when I was a kid.  I almost forgot about it until recently.  The only problem with it is the partial nudity, but it is fast and relevant to the story."
A1P3EE281Z3URI_23326,"There are good things to enjoy, but ""Widows' Peak"" lacks a firm moral framework.  I suspect that is why it sloshes around instead of directing effective satire on target."
A33UO64RKYEWXC_2287,Do I really need to explain this to you? It is Monty Python... What else do I really need to say?
A1WYI5X3BNORSW_4473,"A real tragedy of medicine!!  As a retired nurse, I'm saddened and angry that these poor men were subjected to this abuse!!"
AHPGVRF1P98GT_16654,Had just finished reading the book and must say this video version was a disappointment. The actor who plays Sherlock is far too melodramatic. The rearrangement of events in the video from book were poor choices.
AXA4KBW67OD6Y_19640,"Ok he was a great singer/tenor. He tends to emote a lot, but then, he's Mario Lanza so you know the music is going to be fantastic.
This movie was probably one of his best."
A2MYAFZG6YP57C_6245,I thought it was the perfect movie when it came out and I watch it once a year and enjoy it each time.  Its a great bit of fluff which is sometimes  just what you want.
A1X7FS1H4R02W1_12569,A super quake hits L.A. everyone goes for the elevaders! The first time I saw it was in 3-D! great cast too.
A2TGAOHFPAPPJ1_4739,Too many new spy/hit men stories get lost in guns and long car chases and when nowhere to go with the story long irrelevant dialogues  j
A1BE0DTT5H05ID_18063,"The characters were phony and stereotyped.  Sophia's performance seemed amateurish, and Gable looked way too old for the part.  Storyline was a tired formula."
A2YSJBZIBVNPC6_14967,"Should have, could have been, a good John Wayne movie! Just as well I remember it from many years ago, because this disc had NO MOVIE ON IT !!! ONLY THE SPECIAL FEATURES!!!!"
A1Q27GB6HL0ZZN_7986,"This had a nice touch of both Disney animated and live action, making it a very funny and enjoyable movie"
A3PHL18RYME2UB_15473,"High energy pool film. Hustling

Linked to the ""The Hustler""
Newman was great.

Tom typical acting for him, same person no matter the role. Just like Shia L."
A2PZPE9Z6VZVN9_15810,"I liked the movie, just not a Sidney fan myself. Not good at giving movie reviews. Each and every person that see's something has their own likes and dislikes. Sorry that I could not do better at this."
AQ08SQMOFMHU0_13614,"This movie is for Popeye fans only.  The plot is thin and there was too much ""Popeye"" violence for me."
A3JSLE39XXGSFD_8959,"Good movie.  I'm sure it was great in the 80's, when it came out.  I did not like it as much due to all the hype behind it and my expectations were not met."
AN80JMWQAE1MU_16674,"So is this the actual release I have been reading about or some foreign knock off?

Did Amazon just cut and past some other item description?

So they say the format is ""dubbed""  What ????????????"
A1520S7L43XUHO_9563,Great picture!  Not am action film but plenty of action in it.  Wonderful acting from the best in the business. Funny and full of contradictions.  It is a love story like no other.
AXJRQ2KUKS9EV_16330,Being the follow-up to the original it is still very good. You get to see more of the Monsters instead of being in the dark all the time. A good effort for true fans.
A5W7ETYKMTL23_5045,"Classic flick to watch. I'm sure this one is on several film critics top 100 pics. Gregory Peck is fantastic in it. Excellent storyline, directing and acting."
AC1C3NJX8LSP5_21224,"So bad it's good.  If you like mockumentaries, you'll love this.  In the style of ""For Your Consideration,"" two young filmmakers against all odds make a movie based on the Bible."
A1W2JCN01CTT1V_3849,"It is just a great movie.  The music is just fantastic and the story is pretty good.  If you like Neil Diamond, you will like the movie."
A3T7AD4KVPVPB2_15120,Interesting look at what the nuclear bomb age created in culture and imagination of those times. 1954 technology in filming is humorous at times.
A2HLJPSAQX6KR2_3717,This movie became a classic. If you decide to watch it you will know why. A most have for your collection. I definitely recommend this movie.
A15FZ8EYQPL9JG_23771,"This is a money grab, absolutely right. Better editions exist and they will release the box set again with the fourth film included a couple of months after it's been available on it's own. Isn't that the formula these days?"
AA84EZ8K9RGHA_3054,"Demi Moore is good in any movie.  Not a Big Reynolds fan.  Seems he plays a lot of goofy characters, too silly for me.  Story would have been better if Reynolds character had been a bit more sinister."
A3PGZPDXLW87XS_13369,"Didn't expect too much and was surprised.  An old fort, old town, old haunt.  Good story line."
A2PACRCFW1CXD2_18096,"why did they even make this corny movie. its so over the top early eighties, with stupid weird villains and just was not captivating at all."
A1IU5EPZ2UGB8V_448,Wonderful series. I became part of the family both upstairs and downstairs. I am so in love with all these British series.
A2EGS598FFUC34_18049,This is truly a very bad movie all around performed by stellar actors. Stunning that such a lunacy was ever been produced. Pathetic indeed to watch this movie.
A1HRVMTRMYKAED_10182,"Elvis sort of made the same movie over and over again but this one did have Ann-Margret and that's reason enough to
watch this one.  It had some catchy tunes too."
A1IB1UXTR0AJCF_5189,Watched this with my 13 year old grandson and he loved it. His first introduction to Steve Martin.
A1HO0X1EN7JO23_7841,"i own this on VCR tape, and I thought some day my VCR will die, so I ordered the DVD, now I can watch it all the time one of my favorites"
A32IQ5ALPRXERT_19951,Such a stupid movie. The acting was horrible. The only good thing in the movie was the house. I don't understand how does anything this movie is worth 4 stars.
A1CIMWIIE0P3GY_20644,"Not a total waste of time. Endearing performances by main character, but plot a little far fetched."
A1XZ4EAIC71NZV_945,"I enjoy this film and so I had to upgrade eventually to Blu-ray.
Nothing more to say really other than that it looks and sounds wonderful on Blu-ray.

So, enjoy! :)"
A1HUBEP5DJ6W51_3978,"Guilty pleasure filmmaking at its finest. The story is as old as time, devoid of originality or insight. The acting is atrocious, even old salt Olivier. Ahh, but the music.....campy, overwrought, silly, yet compelling  as a train wreck."
AM66RWPK56ZHV_15883,Disappointed. I wanted to laugh and more than the little that I did! It's definitely a man's movie. Maybe that's why I wasn't thrilled.
ASEZTJV89KAYN_22880,"We didn't make it to the end. Literally hundreds of people ""killed"" in this movie. Colin Firth should fire his manager. Just terrible."
A3J6Q3UC7II4A9_14356,"Excellent performance by George C. Scott,  captured the essence of the man and his character."
A31H1N6RREU2T5_9438,Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are superb.  The story is great too.  Definitely worth an evening watching the TV.
A7DXU5IYKUT63_4293,"An excellent show.
Too bad there are NO John Waynes today  : (
Will need them sooner than later.
There are none.
Sigh"
A3UI6AG5TPBM0G_17996,"I was disappointed in it as a sequel. I'm one who feels it's hard to do a sequel. Actors were ""unknowns""."
A37WPRWZ7A7U4M_8750,"Beautifully shot movie, but do not watch if you just finished the book & loved it. The movie does not follow the book closely at all."
A11LLWESSW47BB_6670,Few movies match the intense reflection of our own culture in such a masterful way. Every time I've seen it I am taken by a new nuance. Truly a stellar piece of filmmaking.
AQVU3UUFFPWNQ_1691,"This is a fun film with some of the greatest stars of their time.  Rita Hayworth is gorgeous, Frank Sinatra is charming and Kim Novak is refreshing."
A1V77LKI6ADNTR_14484,"of Romancing the Stone.

While the chemistry is there between the principal characters, the plot is just ...thing and has moments that are forced for some over the top action and little substance."
A20BDAP0D7G147_20493,A bit too long but watched since it's based on true story.  Best part:  Madonna song at the end and I'm not a big fan of her or Sean Penn.
A2GUK6IX4PS3GY_16334,"The monster scenes were pretty good, the acting in the movie was bad, but i would watch it again. Not even close to being my favorite Godzilla movie, but still worth watching."
A1JYJA9GTTZZ8L_20402,Love the push me/pull me! Dr. Dolittle will delight the hearts of children and adults alike! Recommend that you try it today.
A35JCASWZL0XBH_11854,"The story was ok but wasn't enough to hold my interest--a little weak. I just adore Hugh Grant, he is a very handsome man."
A2AT3GFVBECPNB_16988,I give this movie 3 stars mainly out of nostalgia. I doubt that contemporary viewers will get much out of this unless they are cinematography buffs that enjoy films from this era.
A2070ZAD81MCHB_6146,"Dumb, stereotypical romance/chick flick/""sports film."" Performances by Kevin Costner and Mrs. Travolta are painful to watch.

Really disappointing. We couldn't even finish it."
A2ECCNL2PU4S0S_1776,It's a wonderful movie for children and even adults. It's a shame that my grandson can't enjoy this good movie because Amazon Prime decided to eliminate it from its service.
A2NP6OHM8Q2530_13541,Only watch if you are extremely depressed and want to see people that are worse off than you.
AOPJVEQWGETH9_15138,Classic horror with great actors and special effects. I wonder what a remake would be like? If you like classic horror about giant mutant critters you have to have this in your collection.
A3GB2QONW3YCI2_17779,Didn't remember seeing it as a child until we got into the movie. Pretty sure I hated it back then and nothing has changed. Really sorry I thought it was going to be appropriate for our young children.
AVX30YHHRC3UC_21550,Don't waste your time on this crap. Bad acting and constant darkness make the film hard to watch. I don't know how movies like this get funding.
A36I6YJW4ATZZF_37,"I love this adaptation of the classic tale.  Henry Winkler is, of course, one of my favorite actors.  This is a different slant from the original but it gets the message across none the less.  Well worth the viewing."
A2JAVWK37ARKJY_16862,Excellent WWII movie made in the late 1950's. I bit hokey and predictable at times but very enjoyable. If you liked Das Boot you will like this.
A1LF2ME3S7F4ZQ_13244,It was funny when it came out but my taste have changed it's not funny now
A2FTAB2MF0IDZV_3798,"One of my favorite movies!!  Killer fight scenes, and Queen rocking' the soundtrack!  What more could you ask for?!"
A3QEFEHH6UEPPA_10593,"Remarkable to see today's themes of the stresses of retuning war veterans, in a film made just one year after the end of WW II. Excellent cast and screenplay."
A1O5WYHRRJIZ8U_8270,"What can I say, buy the movie. It's timeless. I received it on time and in good condition. It's worth it."
A1F4WMYZFDOGVL_10306,"I don't remember this order, I think it was cancelled but I am really not sure to be honest with you."
A1PLMMHLEN9LJA_2885,"Kathy Bates in another Stephen King film, and again at her best with Jennifer Jason Leigh in this noir-ish piece."
A70K4IBBTXWAX_14903,"OK, if you're a grade B original Godzilla fan, you're going to like Gorgo. I bought it because it brought back great memories of drive-ins, so pop some corn, invite the right companion(s) to watch, and giggle at the cheesiness.."
A359E5HYSPTH0L_1202,"Was a slow movie drama, without more action. Present a beautiful message to increase the faith. But with low dramatic end."
A3W35LU8SNC6UD_18025,"Strange role for Judy Garland. The film uses actual ""handicapped"" children  in  many of the roles. All special ed. teachers should see this."
ADNGWBLKQPDOL_13122,"THIS IS A TYPICAL TEEN SLASHER MOVIE, BUT I LIKE BEING ABLE TO  COOSE EITHER THE THEATICAL MOVIE AND THE DIRECTORS CUT. I only bought it cause jared padalecki was in it."
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_21711,"Clerks is Semi-Funny, a little too bland and artsy in a bad way at times. I liked Clerks 2 better."
A2QGRE376QBRV5_9444,"This hilarious piece of nostalgia is a classic to me. A group of buddies tie up ends to their childhood and enter adulthood in the late 50's. Stars Daniel Sterns, Kevin Bacon, Paul Reiser, Ellen Barkin and many more."
ANUAJ3OMUH893_16235,"30 minute or so too long, a lot of slow time between Monster scenes.  Skip to those scenes if you can."
A2DQ2KFLIMHKWT_22730,"Not the best, but it was good. I learned Goldfinger was a big fat cheater."
AEVIYGYO0FEOM_13488,I am a fan of both Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astair and enjoyed their interaction in this movie.  It is a good story even if unrealistic.
AS09CJ2GLNXNV_10807,"that's all. I just want the original trilogy without all the CGI garbage. Lucas can retire the special editions, because no one but him enjoys them."
AI4E5IFOT4QER_5269,"Not to every taste but so much better than Coppola's remake. The Siegel-Eastwood chemistry usually resulted in something special on screen, and this is on of Geraldine Page's best performances."
AH06UFDUCQLUI_3427,on time and in good  work good  and i will like more  to see like that  think you  very much
A3AFWV827ECRKL_21958,Seemed long.  My 8 year old liked it but my 5 year old was afraid of the evil man and didn't want to watch the end.
A1A8BHFVJFJOC8_10520,"Horrible acting, weak plot, and silly special affects.  The only good thing about the movie was seeing the ""bad guys"" get their just rewards in the end."
A3HZ5KM2BOZ0UV_10921,"Crazy, funny take-off on ""sanitoriums"" at turn of 20th Century.  Humor bit crude, situations silly.  Great actors having fun with odd script."
A2JHY0CHZUM99M_13380,"It's Charles Bronson at his best, the last movie he made with his lovely wife Jill Ireland.  It was an interesting plot twist as well very entertaining"
A1E6RW8B79CXUS_11401,I was surprised that the animation movie produced in 1939 can be restored with such excellent video quality of DVD. I am wondering why not in audio  part...
AG7S3BZR8WUQP_15401,...just exactly how will children learn from our mistakes in the past if people censor them as if they never happened?
A2FVRQP6NN7DVK_2989,"very disappointed , we waited a long time for season 2 ,only to get syndicated, dark faded 5 minutes of missing footage from every episode ,"
AXX9S5UGOEZR9_16112,"I have been looking for this movie and now that I found it, I can throw out the VHS."
A1GHI5HPVATF4X_20800,my favorite is benny hills one night video stand. that's on golden classics. this one is hit and miss for me
ANE4NGIIN8QRC_14283,Say this originally in 1971 in England. I love the opening statement. George C. Scott did a great job.
A1O6C5UIRZ28ZM_19180,"This movie was entertaining, not Errol Flynn's best, but my
daughter and I enjoyed it. Especially cute the interaction between
Alexis Smith, and Errol Flynn."
A3SAIURS532R4A_5947,"I think Where the Buffalo Roam was much funnier and, frankly, Murray's portrayal of Thompson was better."
A26S4924TX20BB_9114,"Boring, glad I wasn't in a theater. Turned it off after 15 minutes. This is a real disappointment because it is a waste of proven actors."
A36I012JJTZUZ_14490,"This movie has it all a great story, a good cast, and fantastic shots of Barbara Hershey!! A must see for the Guys"
A3BYH766PIVYQN_21348,"The concept was fine, the role was fine, and Kirk did ok...but the movie as a whole just didn't impress my. And most of the actors were poor too."
A36FF88JG8H82I_17005,The  least enjoyable  of the three.  It doesn't  come up to what it could or should  have been.
A2Y7G1T4L7JZFU_15417,Good story but a little more raunchy than I had remembered. A lot of rough humor.
A3GTUWQ0FWK73O_5740,"I enjoy this movie every time I see it.  And thanks to dvd players & a source to buy the movies, we can enjoy
classics like this whenever we want."
A2Q2WGNW2CT7ZD_1318,"This is one the best BD packs there is, the material is perfect, the cards, the way it opens the disc art, everything, its totally worth it. And the movie what to say ? ARE YOU TALKING TO ME ?"
AU4WCFYPN4WT2_18882,"I used to love this film when I was young. After almost 60 years, viewing again, nostalgic, yes, scenery , great, but somehow, not the same as before."
A1SD90LDS2D6R6_8831,Very dark and scary!  Good plot line!  I also love a good twist at the end!
A9FXMNZ20582W_22029,It wasn't what I thought it would be but it was OK to watch once. I wouldn't watch it again though.
A3SOV9HFM5H9T1_679,"There is a profession with the atavism of degeneracy that could take your internal organs with a plot gimmick of doing what you want until death is the final release from restrictions due to metabolic disorder,"
A139R1VPHUMTEO_19238,"Fun to watch and hear, but only if you have nothing better to do.  Alan Jones does a commendable job,
and this film gave him his ""theme song"" !"
A36J9D013TN49N_18848,"My version of the blu-ray was in full screen, not wide screen and there was mild quality all around."
A2CD083RIIKQX9_22095,This DVD would not play in any of the DVD players that I own. I had to throw it away.
AY9TXCNTFF5A8_23757,"It's fun watching old Sci-Fi movies, and how they did special effects back in the 50's when I was a teen."
AZXHHW2HLS0VS_2992,"This sequel is bad. It lacks in all areas just like the first one. There is very little good action. However, a scene involving Jackie defusing a bomb equipped vest he is wearing does feature well done dramatic tension."
A2V4IRJ84T7V7G_847,I can't say enough good about this movie.  I love it.  I've seen it many times and I always get lost in the story and the lives of those incredibly funny and fully realized women.
AUJPJVPBTHCD4_8204,I love Desperate Housewives.  I could honestly watch it again and again. I would love to see this show come back.
A1IJZNHL14362A_23952,"Remember it being better.  Fairly lame by todays standards with weak acting, weak plot, and 80's special effects."
A2XS3OSIXILUNY_23171,This is an old black and white version. The sound was awful so we only watched about 10 minutes before calling it quits.
A18RTNWQZDRB2L_14156,"Content is 5 stars, the movie quality, continuity and other issues is 4 stars. This kind of honor, integrity and ethics is what the world needs more of."
ASBJW6IUVXNN1_1306,This movie is quite interesting. It grabs you through the oddity of its plot. But once you're in it will leave you in suspense till the end.
A220EANOQ8R2JU_19596,"this movie was okay, but he has done better. The breakfast club and sixteen candles are his best works. I still like this one okay."
A22GBH86L94L0I_2635,"Along with ""The Verdict"", this Paul Newman film is one of my favorites from the 80's.  Very glad to add it to my blu-ray collection. Highly recommended!"
AQCZ7TCFAPMKZ_14344,I only bought it because it thought Tom Cruise was in it & he wasn't.
A3U0B6OMLOPQPN_16180,A sexy movie that deals with the forbidden passion between a man and a woman. The movie  depicts the hypocrisy of the clergy during the 12th century.
AV3K4PA5KC9UL_17694,"It is difficult to cram the contents of a great novel into a short movie, but I thought there could have been more time spent on character development."
A3DJS5RZNZZZAQ_16399,Good movie it was the first thing I saw with James Belushi and consider it a classic for the collection.
A2XB83BKUZPSQH_8920,"I am not a big Clint Eastwood fan, especially his westerns.  I had to watch this movie for a class project and end up enjoying it."
A2JQJSIC156XVV_13189,"I don't care for it because of the bug being put in the guys ear, but my husband loves it , so that's why a rating of 4was all I could give it."
A3JU5TJSF36WJF_22928,"Good opportunity to see a young Alex Guinness. Typical WWII movie that features bravery, stalwart determination against increasing dire odds and the every needed romance  touch to satisfy both genders..."
AUTUYKL8525WP_9964,"Good movie if you like the end of the world stuff, but a little slow if you don't.  The action isn't bad but it's not over the top like Armaggedon."
A16ZV4KO7CXXRY_22566,My husband and I could watch only 20 minutes of this awful movie. Don't bother!
A2WKQYPB1RIRB5_15358,"do not remember it's release date, but what a great movie and Harrison Fords performance stellar to say the least"
A35JY6YNYJR9Q0_4074,"A wonderfully inspiring movie in which portraits not just the main character, and the whole family and community who have supported him.  His success was no accident."
A1MUDS9YLLP0VI_14390,what a dumb movie!!! I should the sequel to the first would not be even close. the first one was outstanding!!!!!!
A1FMHHJI1LAEGE_9457,Bruce proves he can be a great straight man in this film. One of the better films to come from the cast of TV's 'Friends.' Very easy on the reality.
A1KG1ZB33JXOGC_18651,Love submarine movies ( Navy movies in general )  Served six years.  And really like James Garner.  The space-filling drama from the crew was not particularly believable.
ADSVSPQ552QU3_23657,"Not a bad movie. Bette Davis places evil like no other. She was more evil in ""Whatever happened to baby Jane""."
A26I260FU4DNM9_10079,"The plot was interesting, the characters were intriguing & well acted. Stood the test of time well. Went on a bit long, and some loose ends brought out the skeptic in me. Overall a very good film."
A1PPW19WROG9KZ_5436,"I choose this rating cause it was the right choice nice product , Yes I would recommend this to all my friends THE SERVICE WAS GOOD THANKS AGAIN"
A2TKOA5QOOYJRI_1954,Got a few R Williams movies after his tragic suicide--Loved it when I saw it and time hasn't dimmed the virtuoso performances--Terry Gilliam was and is a visionary director.
A4W9AJ7H77TR4_23913,"Day be Not dat stupid, duhhh. Ya But, it had a surprise twist in the end?! Ouhhhh. More Hollyweird  Junk.!!"
A3O67YVYV98CEG_4660,"A MAGNIFICENT MOVIE FROM SPIELBERG.....I HAVE THIS MOVIE IN DVD BUT ONLY IN ENGLISH
AND I LIKE SO MUCH WITH SUBTITLES IN SPANISH THIS MOVIE HAS."
A3J3OZ5BPFF2XX_8704,"Special Effects were ok, but the story-line was disappointing. It is a typical attempt to prove that there is no God."
A3GC0EU3MPD3MW_4882,"This one is a real tear jerker, it comes highly recommend.  Yet another great gift choice"
A31U2ALIH48BW3_21221,Couldn't get into it. Thought it was depressing. Tuned out rapidly and dumped it. Hoped for better from John Travolta.
ABLGY08EPFG2F_7366,"Great movie, I watched it with my mother to show her the parallels in our own lives. Always easy to watch and learn from."
ANAYTP154YH5B_17844,Movie case came broken and movie a little scratch but the overall movie is great the package was delicate that's why I think it broke the case
A2YQ6JQINP7HB7_3760,this was a gift. the person who received it was very happy . It was an older person  quite satisfied with movie
AYT8F1980WRKU_13930,Great old movie. I have always been a goof Jerry Lewis fan. He is so cool as Buddy Love. Watch it!
ALTR7YF9LRK0Y_6482,kim bassinger is my all time favorite even more than sharon stone my second all-star cast 5 star movie
A35RDA2R07QEHS_21665,"Nice effects, great high concept idea, but weak story telling. Passes the time, but if you've got something better to do, do that instead."
A1Z67F06QEGKNA_19326,"We did not finish watching this movie, first because it wasn't what we expected and second because it was hard to follow."
AO2JGSF0RSI8V_20481,"Good movie, solid acting.  It is not as good as the book or as close to the real story, but still good."
A2IZTB4FJCB5O8_8668,"I like Jodie Foster, but this role was not a good fit for her. The movie was really out there."
A2K6GJ5V9S6YU1_7648,"I don't know what's going on lately Jodie foster could of done better. But a good mystery, real intense violence like I like it. Not bad at all I love this and other airplane movies. Other than that good movie."
A30I702IF158D4_22524,I purchased this as it was recommended by a friend but could not get into the movie at all but then everyone has different taste you may enjoy it.
A1T696D9BTPSV_2332,I think this is one of the funniest movies of all time. I got it at a good price and in a timely fashion
A1R88BM696RF51_14877,It's a good family movie lots of fun alright story. Very predictable ending but all in all good viewing
A2E7SM64SCOC44_9264,"The humor is on the level of a bar crowd circa 1990, and is degrading to women. For crude folks and Misogynists."
AYGEKID3G7DPW_9440,"The commentary with Tommy Lee Jones was boring...

Still a good movie .Recommended

If anyone has any questions about this please don't be afraid to ask me. I'd be more than happy to answer any and all of them."
AK4HJ2WZ0Q66W_7585,"Superb acting by Jodie Foster.  I liked the ""sit on the edge of your seat"" feeling.  Very good movie.  May watch it again many times."
A1VMI9DVAFF2OL_1069,"I love this movie and how it shows how even in sad circumstances life can still be beautiful. Grace, understanding and trying to make things work out for the best is not always easy but still the best way."
AHJHPSAOEXTS5_9543,There have been better showings of this classic and it would've been better on DVD
A3J9E135CBVPGN_15398,"Fun movie from Disney! Rounding out the Disney library on DVD, enjoyed watching this one. Haven't seen the special features."
A394VWFJ6PAKD9_19458,But for a Charlie Chan lover I bought it for my collection. We'll watch it on a rainy day with popcorn.
ADPZ5HXP5B3N_22589,Only purchased this set for the film The Eyes of Laura Mars. Barbra Streisand sings the theme song to this picture: Prisoner. Prisoner is sung in the opening and closing credits.
AKBRU20R5P51O_23036,"Gave as gift, I assume the kids enjoyed the gift. Rude to have someone rate their Christmas Gift."
ARUSI2LE87YL0_13386,"This episode is obviously an  ""oldie"" but it is still an exciting ""goodie"".  You can watch this one in order or out of order regarding other episodes.  Still good."
A1WDWBBJTJN3AO_87,"I'm a big fan of Christmas Carol-esk stories so I gave it an extra star for that. Of course, the storyline is cheesy and overworked in these types of movies but I actually enjoyed it. And Henry Winkler was excellent."
AVWU4SPOI3HGO_5129,"Dated, but this still is powerful. Great application of a powerful story to film for reflection and a powerful impact."
A15ESIOFPW6Z56_2459,"If you are a sci-fi fan this is a must-have. Set in a world where genetic manipulation has created a class of perfect people, with a subclass of inferior people. Good story of the underdog succeeding."
A8HHZ0P94S54I_18087,"Ah, the memories! Poorly cast Helen Slater, worst acting ever by Faye Dunaway (which worked for her for Mommie Dearest), no plot, creepily bad score and weirdo appearances by Mia Farrow and Peter O'Toole!"
A1THT0J5CKQ9JW_5695,Excellent movie. Everyone should see this movie by the time they are 18 years old. This is a classic movie that holds up over the years. I still love this movie.
A1NGRXYQOKSNCA_7859,So cute! My children and I have watched this movie several times and never get tired of it!
A315BJ680Z3QSJ_5146,Fast and smooth transaction all the way.  One of the best movies I have in my inventory.  Will watch again and again.
A3J9JSBCX99ZAI_2660,I've seen this movie like 4 or 5 years ago and i still fucking have nightmares about it
A3V6A4CFYUX1K9_21640,I am pretty sure this movie was not for our age group. I love Silent Bob so that was the high light of the movie for me.
A29VY8UIW8TQ42_8671,A cerebral sci-fi thriller from Carl Sagan with good performances by young stars on the rise and classic stars on the wane.
A1I7DJZ4H2XOCD_6914,"I haven't watched this movie yet, but it's got the guy from Newsies. I just assume it's going to be like Newsies and I love musicals."
A2VFIOS5CQD4U7_20496,Sean Penn and Christopher Walken are superb actors.  Their skills were not yet developed for this early production.
AU8MOX9LHAJV1_6808,This movie will definitely mess with your head. Early work by Christian Bale. Never read the book but it has made me want to.
AXOW1610NBDSI_3251,"Felt it was a little slow, we got bored & didn't finish it.  Gave it to some vampire buffs."
A3VEFQ25OSXMOQ_19976,"This was a great dvd to add to my collection. Classic radio and movie theater productions of the green hornet. But didn't play, what a shame."
A10XRFM0POSLO2_1973,Fisher King is a wonderful about a man who has to learn to give to others before himself.  One of my favorite performances from Robin Williams and Jeff Bridges.
A18TH1R6RHJ23U_20349,"I liked ""Rescue from Gilligans Island"" a lot, but I did not like the bonus features. I do not like movies that are that old."
A3SJR0WL734EK_18632,"It's a nice blast from the past.  Enjoyed the nostalgia, costumes, excellent dancing.  Story weak, as usual, for a musical."
A4JH8I88GNMOP_10006,The movie was too slow moving. The acting in parts was just a step above amateurish. The story line was weak.
APHEX2PC3SRR9_14051,"great clean family movie, wished they still made stuff like this now days. you want be disappointed , hope this helps"
A2UJVUFR9DXVNM_19284,not nearly as good as the original film or its man sequels. nice try at doing something different though. try again
A1TSUMHV5TUAY8_9743,Good movie about the lives of many people. They were the greatest generation of Americans
A3MCEFHHX3IXJ5_14507,Not everyone can play a hero and this may be an example of how important that is -- Frankie tried but it was hard to separate  the man from the role.
A1EZBT3ST3HR2G_14762,"Terrific comedy but with cursing, which makes it quite inappropriate for children.  Bassinger is great in this movie...very funny, as is Bridges."
A86K58D2BXHX0_23309,"Pure WW 2 flag waving; but, well worth your time to see performers that are not usually seen in films."
A1YTMOPRTD0A66_17123,BOOOOOORING ! Looks like a slideshow with an aimless plot. I am surprised Ben affleck would choose this script. I love a good indie movie and I am very artistic but this has no point. Waste of my time.
A2JKZJ31ABMZNG_7395,"Katheryn and Henry, a great coupling.
How great that Jane got to do a movie with her dad.
I wish they would have done more together."
A3REVHGEV34NS3_20264,"Excellent momentary entertainment. The ""God Only Knows"" sequence is beautiful and entertaining. I've been listening to the Beach Boys ever since this film came out on TV."
A1BLJQQ2EBVNJK_19533,Boring movie. I can't even remember what the best part was. Bronson's 80's movies are better than this and that's not saying much.
AM3G46N2HC0MB_19867,"I liked this movie but not to original its like dirty dancing and dance with me, so not to fond of it."
AR3C1LOCM24BM_13637,I love the actors and the director but the movie is awful...an interesting experiment gone horribly wrong...
A15ZYE35S820RB_18286,Blu-ray is only full screen like the regular DVD and frankly looks no better than the DVD. Don't bother replacing your DVD...not worth the money.
A13NTWHN343NF5_3881,"The original and the best! There can be only one...This movie is a true classic. I have watched several times over the years, and I enjoy it more each time."
A2ZWFASNX8YBEE_8132,The kid and I love watching this movie. Which is good because she wants to watch it every day over and over.  It will always be a favorite.
A1SHLQKJSPCCNZ_2791,Very dated and a black ending. It was interesting that it happened at the same time as the Bill Clinton problems and his little war.
A2T3ZT6SS6TXNH_9956,This movie sucks. Doesn't compare to Knowing with Nicolas Cage. Will never again rent this movie. Not worth my money or time. Not even my kids enjoyed it.
AGCBK7YCN8FUV_18443,This was awfully boring and we didn't make it through the entirety.  The smurf's don't actually make an appearance until 1/2 way through the movie.
A2PZ3UJBFX1FUF_4888,"the additional CD with Mr. Peck's tour in his later years, was a joy and doubled the value of the purchase of the the Anniversary Edition of the movie itself."
A26Y7GIN7YDCYN_4971,"This movie that Gregory Peck made --to kill a mockingbird, brings lot of great memories---I sure enjoyed it for sure"
A33CITSQX4A4OV_1756,A fun movie for the whole family!  This version of Annie is my family's favorite.
AGJJPNIPBES5E_22493,The older ones were best they get less fun as they go. But generally fun and keep my two year old happy while not boring me to death.
A2SOSS8WKCCGUG_20625,I did not think the Ref was funny at all and found the language in poor taste
A2JQJ7S0LOXH1G_18907,"BASED ON A STEPHEN KING BOOK.
STEPHEN KING CANNOT WRITE.
THIS IS WORSE THAN THAT AWFUL ROXETTE AND ABBA COMBINED."
AOKAJBNUIW9R7_2427,An interesting and out of the ordinary plot.  Something that could have happen under a Hitler like government. Very entertaining.
A34CPCRHCGWI0F_16113,The best of this movie was watching a young Pierce Brosnan.  The storyline was kind of hard to follow.
A2GD0AIALY0VR6_13130,"One of my favorite movies...ON T.V.
The actual movie version was horrible with tons of horrible language!"
A3ESB71NBVOQ66_2141,"This movie is not shown on TV or hard to find on streaming.  The storyline was good and if you are a fan of Charles Bronson, it is a must see film."
A9F8E4EO2H4U9_3738,"Product exactly as described! Haven't seen this movie in years and even though it's dated, it's still a great story!"
A34DUL6BB3YRSS_15654,"High quality Disney delight, bring back childhood memories or create new ones with this excellent disney collectable!"
A2WMRKPJTZRLAH_8273,Great animated movie.  Entertaining for kids and adults. As with all Disney movies it has an excellent plot and merges animation with live action characters.
A2WU24FJ53SLJ_1683,"Great movie I hadn't seen in a long time.  Just as good as I remembered.  Nothing better than a Sinatra, Novak and Hayworth movie."
A1PI7NQIENANH4_6041,"I was disappointed with this movie. I knew about the heavy amount of drug scenes before I saw this movie, and enjoy Johnny Depp movies, but this movie was a little too far out for me.
JTB"
A20S7XV2JK0UXL_11164,"Just for my ""rainy day watch times"" - when I want something a bit different to watch!"
A2KAJSVK1OBUAS_14433,"Boring.  Extremely boring.  I was expecting something more enthralling and exciting -- it wasn't.  It may have expressed the history well; however, it was just too humdrum for me."
A3B0P37JWHUSUG_15686,Wasn't a fan of the movie there were some funny parts in it but other than that it wasn't very good
A1CGS3LCLRUPDJ_15381,It was too scary for my daughter so we had to shut it off in the first 30ish minutes. Money wasted!
AMQHUUTD8TJTE_9317,"One of Hitchcock's most famous works. I give it four stars not due to any faults of its own, it is a fine film. However, I just wouldn't feel right putting this in the same class as Vertigo."
A3UR7B7WTS7LFT_18810,As far as remakes go...its not bad.  This one kept me interested enough.  I still prefer the campy original. but this one can stand on its own
A19AN79HUMEMP2_401,"Love the original Avengers series, watched them all as a kid in black and white."
AKFJHL1N63EP3_3361,Great old John Wayne movie. The wife and I have seen it no less than ten times. The Blu Ray version is tops.
AFA8VAS0HNVB5_16085,They don't tell you that this is a DVD-R and it looks like it was recorded at home. Very poor quality.
A38QLESOXKL2P9_20901,This is a terrible movie when reviewing the amount of foul language and sexual innuendo.  Definitely not for my children.
ARVRG41FRWEFH_4137,"Don't think to much if you are space generation person. Bravo, Excellent, beautiful journey to the moon..............."
A2JUK191CVN4G2_22852,"This movie in my opinion was horrible. The graphics and all were fine, just the movie itself was horrible."
A3DU3WSOML75M1_9572,"My husband and I love this movie, even though it's dark and uncomfortable to watch. Great acting by Pacino, Reeves, and Theron, even though the ending is a bit overwrought."
A2OJ3C5PP1QN6T_18132,This movie is not as good as one. even though they tried to keep to same story line. The nothingness just seems to old school They need to find something different for fantasia.
A39V1PW5URQU52_1786,"Got boring, too much foul language, blasphemy, and a nude scene. Would have been great without these things"
A3BCWWZ58ZQ1GN_1491,"The price was good very cheap and in HD and in HD look great thank you ,you need to get all if you are fan of this movies"
A256IA0ATKKRZN_8988,i didn't realize till it was to long that there was only 3 disks in the set not 4. missing the best one
A2W4S9ZI9UZPJF_4147,It is an OK movie.  Not as good as i thought but not terrible either.
A186CN4WE7HCTN_23283,"Foul language.  The movie had its decent moments I like Colin Firth, and we did watch it all the way through, but all five U.S. Agreed that we had not paid theater prices to see it."
A31A7SV73QLTZS_463,too stagy.  maybe I ordered the wrong thing.  did not even finish the first episode.  too boring to watch this
A2IFH4SHNWKLSR_9904,"Titanic is the highest grossing film of all time but this dvd is the worst of all time. No extras, not anamorphic, paramount needs to get with the times. This dvd gets only one star for poor quality."
A2VSBWAPAK1ANZ_5879,Excellent Hunter Thompson flick..... he was out there just like west coast people from the sixties.......
A22FQ9ERINXS53_11825,very depressing saga of a highly disturbed individual who unintentionally destroys lives.  Liam is a well meaning but tragic figure. Great performance.  I would never consider watching it again.
A3JJ21YCMGSKGH_7454,"Doris Day conquered television in 1968 and got great ratings with The Doris Day Show.  Fans love her and they loved her show!  Great family entertainment always, it lasted five seasons."
A3LDRMKLSUWTJ_9707,A few cheesy moments but the movie respected history and I really liked the two leading actors.
A91LE0MPYE8GJ_6360,"This was, good I liked it well Julia Roberts is a good actress and Hugh  Grant is good too well you'll like this.....enjoy this movie!"
A3L1YW0OIL0MY9_3294,"I enjoyed this movie, I like to check these movies before I let my Grandchildren watch it."
AJS7J842QJPCC_9273,I liked this movie. Just felt like watching something that wasn't that serious. I also liked the actors so that made it more enjoyable. I would recommend.
A2O177LWLM8U1S_19555,"Well, it was the eighties. This is the best you'll get, for the most part."
A138VRW81XMB0W_17191,"Though I like Marie Osmond, this movie didn't do her justice. I have seen a better version of this story... sorry."
AM6EBR13D65RW_19319,Good movie but I still don't get what the point of it was.  Kind of strange if you ask me.
A2WVBEKO391ZH0_9060,"Blade Runner is a 1982 American dystopian science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Harrison Ford.  Great ""retro"" movie, enjoyed even more the second time around."
A23Z6K6TO9PWP3_15866,I pulled this on my kindle outside of a McDonalds and laughed myself silly.  There are some Bombs that really took away from the over all movie.  Wish that was not in there but funny nonetheless.
AZQ7O73EAS3VI_7090,It looks excellent considering how old this movie is. I say it is worth it considering how cheap it is as well.
A3FTDZ0T1X1SI7_6276,This was given to my daughter as a present.  She has watched it at least twice and has it in her permanent collection.  She enjoys it very much.
A3NIVB6MZW5TPW_6066,Absolutely the best baseball movie I have ever seen and possible the best movie of all times
A1FMHHJI1LAEGE_22615,Sandra Bullock proves once again that her acting ability is very limited in a roll written for the hopeless romantic. Bill Pullman is as wooden as ever. Would not recommend the film unless you're into completely improbable romantic films.
A3EW4TUSY1HAXC_17559,The Predator creature is back and has some cooler gadgetry. Lots of great action. Not always the best dialogue but decent enough.
A2NE7D8GC41UCL_3917,"""Highlander"" is generally a pretty darkly-lit film, and the blu-ray does help make things sharper and easier to see, so the picture is definitely an improvement over the DVD.  I just wish the soundtrack were louder, especially the dialogue."
A3JUN9ZEGMXOFM_10339,"Great movie, watched it as a kid and still enjoyed it 3t years later. The amazing thing is it did not look cheesy like a lot of the older movies do when you get older."
A3AVTDDYOD2K92_6310,"Just a good boy meets girl , boy loses girl, boy gets girl back at the end. Good characters funny situations"
A1C1L9ZMMB9RKB_3953,"It works great, I don't think it could have been better even if I had got it from a store."
A2WUKBP6RV4IL_7554,Now this is what I'm talking about old school movie my kids liked it and i can watch it again and again with know problem
A12530N7Z1U7B0_8237,I love this movie and roger is so funny to watch over and over. Thanks for another great movie.
A101IGU6UDKW3X_10047,Matt Damon does a great job of whipping out the creep factor in this beautifully produced film.
A216SKRFFQU4ZM_8877,"the movie was okay, I didn't think it was great at anything even though I'm normally a Clint Eastwood fan"
A3KNPYQOSAI0ZH_14868,"Wasn't exactly a huge fan of this movie. Boring almost throughout. Thought it would be more of like The Last House on the Left, but it failed to meet expectations"
A3N0T7IAM4BXYQ_23031,Really liked the movie story line but the language was offensive. Surely there is another word to use besides the f bomb for any & all occasions!
A1YCKWCRIIQSY0_11528,What a stupid movie!!! I didn't throw it out because i wasted money on it!!!
AGMLLSL26JB5C_10839,It about two people falling love with each that is true story can't remember what the pilot was it so long if you after it was done then I can tell you what it was about?
A7TQ0DM22W064_18035,"No way in hell this could happen, i was in the Air Force and this was just plain dumb, the flying parts were pretty good though. Peter Strauss was the good actor in the whole film."
A3GH786WSGN0Q8_13942,"I love this movie, because it may seem like your typical 80's slasher flick, but its anything but! The scares are original, and twists are great."
A1K45ILPB5IYQ6_11264,"Very disappointing...None of the subtitles work...

Even the subtitles for Indian language conversations didn't display...taking it from a 5-star movie to a poor quality DVD..

definitely not worth buying"
A6XY57CBHJ95G_17397,"It's a predictable story with a young cast of unseasoned actors.  But, it's worth seeing."
A2MHJWB5NHVIED_18136,"No spoilers. How ever , Didn't like it at all found it bellow par at best the acting was beyond the worst and the script again nothing to brag about. It needed more work before filming."
A2CBA33RRC5OOS_15507,I didn't think much of this movie when it first came out years ago but have grown to like it great film
A23MANJA5ECR2K_12092,"very dry and slow. compared to the current Sherlock holmes by marvel, this one put me to sleep."
A1I8I40QOK6BNI_19056,Every trend has to start somewhere and the idea of stringing together bits of satire based on current events and movies obviously lends itself to Kentucky Fried Movie.
A38Y8Z0IWJJS9F_21756,"Interesting concept, yet a very silly plot, and the acting was light hearted however not enjoyable to watch. I really like Meg Ryan, but this is not one of her finest moments. This movie just didn't flow naturally.  Not recommended."
A2FHM6DSCFOABL_10033,What can anyone really say. This is John Wayne at his best with the added attraction of Robert Mitchum. An excellent old western.
A25LFXCQLN267D_7972,"One family-oriented fairy tale with a good dose of comedy, fantasy and magic that will enchant you to watch it time and time again."
AKJOC4YUGIIBA_22668,"same here. no 3d = no sale, even at $8. i wish these companies would just do it right, from the get-go. now it will be years, if ever, before i get to enjoy it again."
A1YROIOZO813GP_13251,"The film transfer is shabby,, you can tell right off that this product was cheaply done, but and I say but....just happy to finally get this movie, Could have been done better and with extras"
A1JBB9NOMA5IE1_7261,"Was glad to get a copy, had seen it originally on TV.  Wish some of the extreme violence could be edited out as is done in TV version."
AHUBBM4TBHOX1_9641,Cute movie.  Was too young to have appreciated it when it came out. Now the I'm the characters' age so I thought I'd finally give it a shot.  Glad I did!
A378JSF2LMHHSJ_3049,Always wanted to see this because I love Demi! I really enjoyed it good story and lots of Demi she's such a babe!
A47ORMU1FSD6L_565,"For pure action, this movie is hard to beat. Harrison Ford is at his best."
A1257IUDB3M1A_14685,"The DVD played very well. We had an old VHS copy and was happy to find it on DVD format.
Thanks, jimjam"
A35DBX3AKEXI8M_16083,I cannot believe how many Jason movies were made. Watched them all. This one for being #7 was just as good as the first.
AKQRKP2OQ8ZHL_21164,"If I could rate ""Baby's Day Out"" at negative star(s), I would. This movie is worse than a screen full of pop-up ads. Utter garbage. AOL installation CDs have more entertainment value. Zero stars."
A36OW0HB2Z4VWQ_15600,"Disks in sets 1 and 2 are defective.
Will not play in any blu-ray player.
Chapter listing is very difficult to read on back of front label. Looks like a afterthought to keep cost down on printing."
A23Z1WPGSQ01MA_22629,This movie was more about action and less about character development. It's entertaining but likely you won't remember much about it a week after you've seen it.
A2QNTZX12SKY4Z_7874,Great travelogue - really interesting. Does not do nude scenes at the museums so is great for family.
A3JGYBGIHHZ3VF_18192,Very rushed except when showing clips of stars' performances which could have been substituted with interesting facts.
A3UQ6AU4GORNB8_16009,I love this 80s chuckle fest.  Women outsmart the system at every turn and fall into victory.
A2P7OEE5NOT86Q_23697,"Very disappointed, to much cussing, and used God's name in vain! That was the last straw for me."
A1ET4VVQGQA0MB_7908,"Another triumph for disney, between my nieces and myself we've almost worn this one out already."
A22E48RZ4RMA0E_2805,"We got the film because we really love Dustin Hoffman. The plot was amusing and interesting, but the end was a total downer. Watched it once and then took it to Bookman's for a trade in."
A2WHU3WWXDSO3K_6260,One of my all time FAVORITE Hugh Grant movies! Great date night Romantic Cuddle Comedy!
AESWJXEYLTTR_16928,"This story probably could have happened in real life, but I hope it isn't supposed to be a depiction of the way it really was.  Somewhat far fetched and a bit vindictive."
A2X6GEC6LCDN4S_332,"The counter scene when Allen's character says he is robbing the bank and has a ""gub"".  That is hilarious!! Many more humorous scenes!
One of America's best comics ever!!"
A36GITOLRPC6RV_18212,"I expected more. I've seen a remake with Jody Foster: it actually repeats this older version but with better qualities of color, sound, etc....
I could've easily managed without it.
Thanks
Alla"
A32L2W1C7I5A8O_9052,"I'm not much of a sci-fi fan, so my review is skewed.  I watched about 1/2 hour of this movie and then turned it off."
A3KWPKON5R5OJF_22976,"The special effects are good. The movie a waste of time. I wouldn't recommend it. If you don't watch, you're not missing out on anything."
A3EC1CRC96VKLL_19534,"This movie is fun camp, especially since Joan is about 40 years older than her love interest.  More like a circus documentary than a movie, the plot drags big time.  A must for lovers of Joan, and camp..."
ADGECU172C477_9163,Harrieson Ford has done better Science fiction of course but still a good movie  a  a  a 
AC15KT9GCUHW4_11152,Before you purchase this DVD be warned: The sound is in MONO format. Yep... that's right. MONO!
AN87O30BBFY2M_8465,"Not a great movie, but one that's action packed and is a decent killer of 2 hours."
A40TC4IH1FP4K_11626,"I have a high tolerance for bad sf films, but I could not make it all the way through this one. It might serve as a soporific if you need background noise to help you sleep."
A4MQNP8PDTFW8_6950,This movie is still entertaining after several years since it was made.  A good mystery/comedy with Bruce Dern doing a great job.  I totally recommend it.
A1HZNVXZLXUP6J_15976,I was an Ernest Borgnine fan and was hoping he'd  carry the movie...he didn't. I couldn't make it all the way through.
A1U5E7P6R1NT3E_5958,"Actually, this movie was so bad I only watched a bit of it.  I was looking for comedy, not stupid."
A1MR860K6SBLJE_10650,The movie is a good movie worth watching due to good acting by actress Katherine Hepburn.  The movie also features excellent acting by Peter O'Toole and by Anthony Hopkins.
A1V5TRJXTI6F01_16197,"This movie is okay. It is funny, as any movie with Lily Tomplin in it is. Bette Midler surprised me and was very funny as well."
A306XJR2YRJI6Y_940,I love this version better than special edition or directors cut. The 135 minute version is the best and I still love the theatrical version better
A2OPEUPCCYWAGK_11023,"This is a nice feel-good movie.  I was a little surprised at the main male character's role/personality, but it all turned out fine.  Somewhat of a predicable plot with a few twists."
A10R1GZPWCIGZ_23690,"This is rather a campy movie about an aging head of a beauty factory that discovers ""wasp serum"" as the way to renewed youth...unfortunately it has some very bizarre side effects!"
A3OLZZEIADQWDN_21895,I didn't really prefer this movie. It was a good try but just not my cup of tea! Sorry :(
A36R5QTVVGUC52_19999,"This movie was made in 1969 for TV.  With the spiffy cover and digital release date (2006), you might think it is a newer version.  Far better versions have been made since this one."
A1CN6G63A9LPKX_18672,The quality of the film just isn't the same as what TCM shows each year.  Someone has a better copy out there- tell me- who is it???
AJF4Z1FWLYAS2_15227,Good war film with some truth in the actual battle scenes s few dead spots in this film but all in all great film
A4SOPY8QZSNE6_7990,What a wonderful feel good movie that'll put a smile on any face of any age!
A4M6WK8XG5O6X_14771,"Even William Shatner's overacting is no match for Ernest Borgnine's over the top warlock. It's clear Borgnine is really enjoying himself here, while Shatner looks like he'd like to be somewhere else."
A1II8XP9B54XY5_9139,"OK, this is a little drippy, especially at first, but stick with it and you'll learn a valuable lesson about courage."
A29MA1MSFRRBYX_2839,"Fantastic transfer. The clarity, and depth of color is wonderful. The movie, as always, is one of the best from 1939. Both Ginger Rogers and David Niven give splendid performances."
AGSYNSJSH76I6_8044,"My daughter-in-law had never seen the movie.  Now, I think she is a devotee to this silly thing! Welcome aboard or be gone with the Schwinn!"
AG4KTNDOR3KVI_10561,"This psycho-drama is disturbing and fascinating at the same time.  But there seemed to be unnecessary violence and bloody scenes, which detracts from the film."
A18F0JJ1UJZWAS_8794,A bit boring. Very dated but an important step on post-apocalyptic film continuum. Watch it to get your bearings on the genre but not for great filmmaking.
A2KBCK4ZGTZTL8_19414,I think the story was slow.  There was more information that I wanted and did not get.  Acting was great though.
A2X02RWQ8RFYUW_14272,This is great for World War Two buffs. If you are looking for an action hero movie this will not work. More like a history documentary.
A3PYBA841979JX_15232,"I love (adore!) LZ!

But back in 60's they thought you had to add corny stupid stuff (aka gangsters, etc.) to sell it.

The part that just highlights them is great footage!"
AE840I29WBE5O_15843,"Funny movie. Never seen that much bad luck before, made it very funny. Good casting."
A1KHEP4P4FUTDJ_17634,"I was told by Amazon that this DVD had close captioning, however, it does not.  I need close captioning since I'm severely hearing impaired.  I had to give the DVD to my sister."
A55M888XKRCKH_20182,"This 2nd film is a solid outing, but it falls short of the first in many areas.  Certainly worth seeing, but nothing to rush out and buy."
A3CZQOZUDRWDR1_8850,"I hate this movie. I'm sure it was made well, and Marlon Brando is easy on the eyes but man, it's depressing as all get out."
A35V8JJBYADQB9_21314,"a lot of the old biker type tough guy stuff
I road a Harley for many years, not in a gang"
A1DJSWVSI1TVRY_17096,30 minutes nurse in and I have no idea what this move e is about.  Huge disappointment as Ben Affleck is a draw.
A244C2ZZ4BLGER_5771,This is another of my favorite movies that I had on VHS and could not find on DVD. I was so happy I found it!!!!
A24WP0PWWY6ZB3_14270,"A role Scott was made for. A bit melodramatic, and Patton's dismissal over-simplified, but a great movie for July 4th. (reviewed on July 1st)"
A8K5I4MF6QCGJ_5013,"A fantastic old classic.  Awesome to have it on blu-ray.  I definitely recommend this movie to the young and the old, alike."
A1SUBHCDZM4HU3_23177,"Wasn't the one I was looking for, but still good to add to my library."
A1XJV0IXHZC6Z6_15064,A little corny and sometimes silly but it's always good to see Gene Hackman in anything. Not too many surprises.
ANGFDOSY7R38L_20826,Enjoyed this so much more when it was originally released but my second viewing on Amazon was somewhat enjoyable.
A173XGL3VM8B2N_11868,"I lived there in the 70""s and I am a gay man and it did not cover it very well. There is so much more to say about gay sex in the 70's."
A1VMD5ACO83C6G_14205,Hilarious western spoof from Blake Edwards (the man who brought you (THE PINK PANTHER).  James Coburn plays a conniving gambler on a quest for stolen gold. Carroll O'Connor is solid as the crooked lawman chasing him.
A3CXPJJ15E1545_3458,I will say that I enjoyed this movie. It's one of my favorites in the series. I thought this was a great sequel with a great cast and great story. You should definitely see this.
A2I7OXHWWVR3JV_16062,Audio in english with no subtitles. Mr. Magoo is a well writing cartoon. Is based in an older person. And was one or perhaps older cartoon in the history of the cartoon.
A219WFI4NFP6D8_13764,Not the best quality but it's kind of a B-rated movie.  My stepdad enjoys it!  One two three four five.
APIH604ROOZAP_414,A number of actors have played the part but I like these 2 actors best of all.
AU0Y6Z7JPW0FG_11181,Frankly the movie bored me. The actors were the best but the story could not give them the platform they needed.
A1OYE503LOE9TR_21218,This is for children with imagination. I watched this 30 times as a kid and loved it. I have no idea why its pretty simple and bad. Kids may still sit through it.
A2WL9Z6FYNW8X7_16579,Possibly one of her better earlier films.  She hadn't hardened in Miss Barbara Stanwyck yet.  She enjoyed working with Mr. Fonda & you can tell.
A1LLH4NHIQ2SP7_2259,"Or anywhere!
This should be required study for Social Science, Art, History, and Religions in High School.
This is another work I have owned in several formats over the decades.
Yes, I CAN sing along with the ""Camelot"" song!"
AMF17DNTWF9O0_12142,I can't believe that James Mason and Donald Sutherland could possibly be in such a bad movie. The remake with Johnny Depp is Oscar quality compared to this.
A2CEOAUIFBB2QZ_21676,"This movie was OK, but not my taste.  Younger people would probably enjoy it more than I did.  My rating might not be a fair one"
A3IAU2BQAMMFD7_14037,"This movie was just not my cup of tea.  The acting and the production was great, but the story itself is too confusing to follow.  I was bored 10 minutes into the film!"
A2H5PY6EUOSWS_17456,Main character was clueless.  Acting was amateurish.  Plot nearly non existent.  I wonder how movies like this get made.  Maybe because people like me are foolish enough to watch them.
A267IXCC7UK1HY_11377,"terrible voices,  awful music. . .

The people are very good-looking but their voices are no good and the ""melodies"" are embarrassingly bad."
A34K8D262NZQJF_1345,I have heard this film as one of those films a lot of people watch over and over or to just watch in awe the acting and directing that takes place on film. A good movie for any dvd collector!
A1Z2JQ4OPWI9RR_18544,Half way decent quality but does not appear to be remastered.  Watching on a small screen would be more tolerable (in my opinion).
A3RB9PECLH84S7_3966,I received the movie on time.  It was a great movie.  The Blu-ray version is the only way to watch this movie.
A2I6SBUGP9RQ0U_19674,"It is a plain and simple plot, but I just happen to like the Coneheads regardless of whether it is a movie or elsewhere."
A3W2BXESONZH0P_22421,"Every other word was an F expletive.
Plus lot of senseless killing and Ronchi scene at the end. Sorry, but if those things were eliminated I would've given it five stars."
A2PI3IIBPG2VI2_9882,I enjoyed it just like I did when I was 14 and saw it for the first time. Many scenes stayed with me all these years no matter how much movies I have seen. A true entertainment classic.
A1KKRLQJ3U2K6F_22845,It was a very slow film - too predictable - and boring in places.  Acting was robotic in places.
A1L1WAPRFZD7CL_3339,"I have been loving Scooby Doo since he first premiered in 1969.

This is another great addition to the Scooby lineup."
A39UQRMB884CZZ_7957,This is my daughter's favorite movie.  It is one of those that all ages will appreciate for different reasons.  Lovely humor and extreme characters.
A10EAU3IKJUM8X_20553,I didn't like all the cussing.  I didn't even like the storyline.  Although great acting.
A3RVMMZYOXQNKL_22630,This is a waste of a good DVD which I could have loaded other stuff on.  This movie was terribly boring and I believe that miscreants at our prisons should be forced to watch this movie as punishment.
A38OZHPS0HEIE1_19401,I had a hard time understanding the story plot of this movie.  It just didn't make sense to me.  That is the reason for the three stars
A3CKLC375W7M1S_2490,A bit of a slow start but it picks up. Liked the acting and overall plot. Somewhat typical coming of age story.
A3M7HFZ6XKXOUE_6498,Incredible and intense film. The blu-ray has no features but the film is incredible.
A393IH3B8J6NIW_12997,"This movie has a lot of action, and great acting by Eddie Murphy, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys action and thrills in movies."
AE6U92RGHPNY1_12298,These two guys knew how to make people laugh.  It was good to see them perform again after not seeing them for so many years.
A3VERK02U6X7LZ_22195,Simplistic film without much character development.  Rebecca De Mornay needed to provide more than her looks.
A1ZSGGUOBC6P1I_18867,I don't know why it says it was Digitally Remastered. I didn't notice any better quality than any other version I have saw. It seemed worse in some places.
A2B1DT7C5I69MA_10222,"This was a replacement movie for one that was borrowed, then damaged. Since this movie was released in at least two different editions (edits) we were glad to find the same (earlier) versions!"
A3FZJWYYMWHSNK_841,I love this movie and rate it as one of the best of all movies.  Whenever I feel down this movie always pulls me out of it.  Dolly Parton is a National Treasure in my book.
A2T3BVMY01BLPZ_18962,"This film is from the 80s - not the Michael Moore we know today. It's worth a watch, but nothing to write home about."
A3VFEICZRXOFOB_23516,"I live in the US and cannot watch it.  These DVD's should be red flagged or sold only on European sites.
Sending backt"
A1BY6EWVPXWVOX_10192,"Viva Las Vegas by Elvis Presley, with Great actors such as Ann-Margret, Cesare Danova, William Demarest. Great Music, Dancing and Songs. Elvis 7 Ann-Margret were Wonderful! I recommend this movie to all elvis Presley Fans! Great Collector Dvds."
A12EWTN266O78P_5366,this was a very good movie for family and just to sit around and watch I would recommend this movie to anyone that ask about it
A2MVHL5UK9HLL2_23843,Someone as a very bad imagination when it comes to making movies. Better then a soap opera or sitcom but that's about it
A1PT17P9KF7B35_19898,This is a great old TV series and certainly an asset to my vast collection. I expected digitally mastered though and quality is far less than I thought it would be.  Picture is fuzzy and sound is awful.
A2T7TZQXNTTYH0_19853,Not Good.  I thought this would be a movie about the Pholadelphis Experiment.  It wasn't.  It was about something else and I still can't figure out what the plot was about.  It was boring.
A1EFUTT0BHHQ0A_5498,"I ALREADY HAD THIS IN WIDESCREEN, BUT ANY TIME I CAN UPGRADE TO DTS I USUALLY DO, SINCE I HAVE A GREAT SOUND SYSTEM AND CAN APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE."
A2IBE01ZFGBHPQ_12087,New government project is on the line for first mind-power control. The results are in as you witness an new wave of terror.
A1ZOSOAKGSMEU2_8396,Great story line interesting and really funny-super salty language throughout- more so than most movies- all in a Bostonian tongue!
A2YTRUKN537J4K_22920,This movie was very inappropriate and I would not recommend it at all.  Save your money and spend it else where.
A1XXFXNL0TDS5X_15238,"I watched this movie, because of the cast, waiting for a good movie. The movie as
it continued only got worse. This movie is not worth watching. If someone wanted to make the Worst War Movie Ever...this is it."
AFPGG6UHF7EEF_7142,Classic Kevin Bacon movie.  I love how you think you know what going on and at the end theirs such a twist that it leaves you speechless.  Great Movie and you will not be disappointed.
A3N4QSYHDXXYFY_18480,STORYLINE IS VERY GOOD.  WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER IF THE SWEARING AND SEX WAS OMITED.  NOT SURE WHY PEOPLE THINK THEY NEED TO ADD IT.
AWNIGR45L3GIH_3748,"One of my favorite movies.  I still love the music and Neil Diamond's performance is wonderful.  His music is as ever, just perfect.  I've had the sound track for many years and now I have the movie."
A2M8YG0P5S0AMF_21936,good classic peanuts ..but all but one of the songs was terrible. I was a bit board with if. But still a must for all peanuts  who want it all. The animation is still great though..
A2QCV09RS094YU_15517,"As these (two) Alice in Wonderland DVD's were purchased as gifts, my only feedback is that they were very much enjoyed"
A32WEVCTNVAG3S_4136,Great film!  Shows combat on small scale but well done. Tells about Hurtgen Forrest which few Americans know about.
A9L80JEHO7LGM_7816,"A fresh new twist to the Cinderella story.  Wonderful mix of a fairy tale, modern romance/comedy and musical.  Will make you smile, laugh and cheer.  Great movie for the whole family.  Ours fully enjoyed it (ages 10 to 52)."
A26MO4WIGB669B_4993,This is my all time favorite movie and book.  Read the book as required reading in 9th or 10th grade and fell in love with it.  Gregory Peck is wonderful.
AAC1G5QQYXTCT_20359,WATCHING THIS IS LIKE WATCHING MAPLE SYRUP DRIP FROM A MAPLE TREE IN WINTER...REALLY SLOW
A15WKAFW528U6_667,TWO GREAT ACTORS THAT TEAMED UP AND MADE A SO SO STORY LINE WORK GREAT. WHO DOSNT LIKE KIM BASSINGER. RICHARD GERE RIGHT UP THERE WITH THE BEST OF ACTORS.
AMMRGJ5V3WP3H_6532,I don't think so. Good acting performances and interesting plot captivate the viewer during this mystery/thriller. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and think you will too.
A2SO2GZJ0PWETC_8102,"Have always loved this cute movie. Very smart and perfect for little kids and not so little kids. pleasure to watch. Animation is unique and the character design, and the story imaginative."
A1AVXUUEPZX7Z0_1016,this has to be by far my favorite movie of all time.  It really makes you want to believe in life outside of our universe and to have it on DVD is even better.
A1Z8KRA75RJ6C_1319,"Taxi Driver is a classic film, and in this presentation comes not only with the movie in blu-ray (that have an incredible image and sound) it also came in a perfect packaging and with lots of very good extras."
ADSRRN0LE502T_21356,I love the movie but this version did not play on my machine.  It was not compatible with it and I should have read the small print.
AO3LQK1YNBNDZ_2248,came on time & my grandson loves this movie. It's one of his favorites. he loves anything with elmo any of the sesame st. characters.
AQ7AA5G9G224E_21303,"It was alright. Good Action, but cheap story having to rely on nudity to get some to watch it."
A2EXMGQEFLW0LD_7347,"It a fair rendition of the story. Plenty of action, a sizzling scene with Sharon Stone, an interesting idea of reality versus fantasy.
I like it because it's a guy flick. No romance (really)"
AS5C3SKU5NYM5_11467,"Unintended illustration of why European royalty had to disappear.  Stomach-turning posturing by Berger, superfluous celebration of full frontal nudity, pointless smiles by Schneider, unnecessary elaboration of fatuous court politics, embarrassing evidence that Wagner was a fraud."
A3FH5CHYXRZPTR_1706,"I believe this is the closest to the original story of Annie.  So enjoyable, especially the music!"
A3A02QF8URP81W_17675,"I did not dislike it nor like it, came with the Rudolph so it was giving to a little girl as a grift she loved it."
A1XWTPRFEW87NW_635,"I grew up watching this movie everyday on VHS, a complete classic! All music and movie fans should purchase this DVD!"
A2SMUTOINJQDU3_15411,Tamara and Stella are both watchable as always but the script is heavy on action and somewhat low on plot.  Great scenery in Hong Kong and (maybe) Macau.  Enjoyable to watch as pure entertainment
AW4MT9WP95TVD_2683,"The Grudge has maybe two or three good moments, but they are quick frights and hardly enough to sustain a full length feature.  Recommended for SMG fans and those afraid of close-ups of young Japanese children."
A2I86UMQ8CQL2Z_8266,It was worth waiting for.  The blu-ray is the definitive edition of this beloved family classic that many of us first saw when we were children.
A3CCBY66FZZFZJ_13813,Good movie! I watched it a long time ago and again just recently. Still a good movie!
ABTZVIK6E5104_9117,Pretty decent flick. I think if I watch it again and pay better attention ill like it more. It is def a thinking persons movie.
A39EPO6YD7JJ5S_23438,"Elements and scenes from the original are oddly missing from this, or have been edited down. If you are expecting to see what you saw in the original broadcast, sorry, its not here."
A36YVSRFMCW39O_11059,"I really like the original Star Trek, some episodes more than others, but all are great"
A206JYZTUXTFAS_10710,"A  good  rendering  of  the  Cinerama  film without  the  lines  from  the  three  different  cameras.  Interesting  story,  but  not  great.
With lots  of  stars."
A23WA7Y8FZVEE8_14899,"What can one say about Gorgo?  An attempt to cash in on the Godzilla trend.  A bit lengthy and silly, but if you want all the giant monster films, this is one of them -though less important."
A3OG9MBQKZP7LZ_6935,I'm one of Alfred Hitchcock's most devoted fans!! Rate this one high up there with all the rest!! Great buy.
A3TQEIXVEMB9ZO_10726,"You never know what you can endure unless you are challenged, as these women were.
Could I have survived this?"
ABRRATI739GFO_12422,"This movie is pure 80's. It is just the right amount of cheese. Plus, any movie with Harry Dean Stanton and Emilo Estevez automatically gets an ""A"" in my book"
A3UXFZXMRXM25O_8524,The quality is good but some scenes are missing.  I am assuming this is a bootleg copy of the original.
A25T9ZE7OU4M14_1647,I've always liked this version of Joan of Arc. Milla Jovavich is quite good as the Saint.
AKMPMWKXF5GZV_5954,"Jubilant morosity hits the desert road, slays dragons and cooks the eggs in a Hunter stew of the ridiculously pondered fare of life.
Hell, the movie itself could be considered ""To weird to live; to rare to die!"""
AENESN505A721_15128,"awesome black and white movie, simple entertaining and for its time great to sit back and relax with a nice cup of coffee"
AA7MOZZU6FIHE_4446,"Not your usual Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze kind of film.  Definitely tongue in cheek, and I loved it!!!"
AFSDXMAYEQLJR_14044,A well done remake of the classic Agatha Christie novel. It's a good cast with a well written script.
AJ6I35OWXX94P_21061,"Early Tommy Lee Jones and expected green, but plot, other actors and story did not help this waste of time."
A209OUARFGHDH2_2750,"The first full feature movie retrospective of the Apollo Moon flight program. Chocked full of interview clips with the flight crews, but no ""on-camera"" time. Still an excellent film."
A2WROBVIC6OQTJ_888,I love this movie so much!! I am grateful that it showed up in time for the holidays with my family...because I know we watched it at least 5 times in a week! Thanks for being fast!!
A3L5965NY9SJAX_21725,"whatever happened to john laroquette? i remember he had that one movie. that was several years ago though. is he still alive? ah, who cares?"
A1RE3XWWCCT2UW_18493,It is from the UK & won't play in region 1. This is the second DVD I have purchased with this problem (Alistar Cooke's America was the other.
AK8SM4V93F2CO_19395,"I liked the newer version better.  But, I'm glad I watched the old one anyway."
A1PKFX0KXCFQR0_12911,"The special effects are less than spectacular, however, you have to consider when it was made. I only bought it because Leonard Nimoy was in it."
A2VWNOZZQSW2B9_883,"I received the product even faster than expected, the price was excellent and the product is just as described, great!"
A248GUMT8WVVQ1_23909,"I don't care about Julia's acting being good or bad in this one. All that I care is that this movie stinks. It's bad directed, bad screenplayed, the actors are uninspired."
A3HZHVKY58P082_20390,This had a funny story and provided a few laughs.  Always like Cary Grant and his acting so still enjoyed watching.
A14XL732VSD2PP_4182,"Pretty unspectacular. Looked like a low budget affair and some of the acting was not so hot. The historical aspect was interesting, but the movie itself was not."
A30J181BO90YVZ_15315,"Good cast of some old time actors, good story.  A western theme you hardly ever see, set at a California coastline. Marlon Brando did a good job, and Karl Malden was excellent.  Ben Johnson, as always was a treat."
A11EY1NJY2CO1I_5408,I think this movie is very funny and like the charisma that Tim Allen and Kirstie Alley have together.
A3FUV4IRCO5HHB_13248,If you love robots and sci fi adventure check this out. It gets more interesting as time goes by.
A2RLJBBIE9MI0M_22254,"I have pretty much determined that ""people in the know"" in Hollywood do not know crap.  This movie was slightly entertaining, not Academy Awards quality at all.  If you like silly, stupid humor you may like this."
A25G0O16Z8U9N7_21917,A decent and funny film .lots of laughs and stars make this a good and often disturbing and funny take on an imaginary hotel and its guests.
A27EBLHJEJETIV_11014,"I don't know which I enjoyed most, watching the movie or finishing the movie. Don't watch it alone, unless you're like me, daringly naive. Next time I watch this movie, I won't be alone."
A2QTN70WEWSMVC_12742,"This was a very well used movie, most of it jumped and shook but I was able to at least finish it. Then throw it away....."
A3V6RHRIUZ7KHO_951,"Wow - this movie has aged badly, very, very, very badly.  SS is not that great a director at all...yuck."
A3F31WV27FJMFM_23696,"All I can say is the 1-star is for the Good Times DVD.  They have their logo throughout the film, thereby ruining it for the viewer and rendering the DVD useless."
AM775LAV45IEP_14281,"Just finished O'Reilly's book ""Killing Patton"" and thought I would watch the movie again.
It was just as good as I remembered it to be.  Well worth the time."
A3N9A9XBCUJNQ4_8943,One of Al Pacino's other works after the Godfather parts 1 and 2.  Basic plot of this is how a bank robbery goes wrong.
A2PFK1B5ESE15J_7190,There was much more to Charlie Chaplin than I ever knew.  Robert Downey Jr. is excellent as this character.
A2PHJ7RJBRK2N0_15998,"Doris Day is at her superb best in this great musical. Despite a great outdoor musical number in the park, the film remains a little too stage bound, but we are lucky to have this on film for the ages."
A3PHVY1OCXWVWJ_7226,"Best movie by Robert Downey Jr. bar none.  Outstanding acting, great story telling, very good cinematography.  Supporting actors did an excellent job...."
A2DI3H7BJ9QCRU_19767,An old film and not too well done. None of the actors really did a good job. Nothing at all like other Agatha Christie stuff
A1KLJ8ZX35F37U_17895,"It was a dull movie, and was long in the tooth(old saying).  It came in the time allotted.  No problems with the movie, otherwise."
A2A1V3C39RJUK7_17636,"Of course, this is a classic.  I suppose it was adequate for its time, however, its certainly not the equal of Alastiar Sims 1951 performance.  Too Bad Amazon doesn't stream that one!"
A3IBUHRXDQQZNT_13730,"What's not to like? You have a quick witted smart talking British spy, Michael Caine, who outsmarts the bad guys in understated British style. Probably exactly what happened in real life."
A3GW2F663MS7Q6_12779,I really love all the actors in this movie but not the movie itself. I feel the performance of these actors was wasted on a not so great storyline.
A2U6FS36VMLJ04_9784,"Good WWII movie with a good cast.  Story followed a tried and true formula, but with this cast it seemed to work well.  Special effects are weak."
A1CKZZBM4BV0TK_11526,Not much to say about this one. I turned it off about 40 minutes into the film - it was that bad!!!!!
A2FDLXW6D4XUDY_193,My daughter liked the Santa Claus movie she now knows who Chris Kringle is according to the movie.
A3U0ER6TKM83C8_15629,"This looked like a Guys and Dolls want to be, why didn't they read the script before starting to shoot this movie.  There were some great actors in this it  ""could a been a contend a""  Oh well win some loose some."
ALQU5INTDDHZB_12464,"The Miami Vice collection is fine.  Mill Creek is the worst.  Their customer service is horrible.  If you have a bad disc, they want you to exchange the entire purchase at the point-of-sale.  Older titles go out-of-print very quickly."
A3KJBPJ0T0MNPS_18864,This is a good movie that had a lot of surprises around every corner. I am happy I added it to my collection
A2MGGP3MVYBVX9_640,No one can play a role like this but Harrison Ford. Just another great move in a long line of work!!
A2ZN88NLI7VHF3_22790,I thought the movie was hard to follow. I know this director puts out some weird stuff. You really have to like his humor. It is very different.
AG4U2AOI7RAD6_19139,Laura is a classic. If you enjoy the old mystery movies you will enjoy this one.
A2SBX7UU9PPJUA_12762,"Great classic movie from a simpler time! From an era where all the money was spent on the actors, not special effects."
A944UW68HGUY5_13767,Watch with subtitles turned on to get the mumbled jokes. This film is about 80% successful. I am not sure  quite what went wrong because it could have been hugely funny rather than just sort of funny.
A2DRYJZZC6Q6N4_6777,"of course. old steve martin movies and goldie hawn's are really the old fashioned comedies.
i just had to have that movie on dvd as i liked it in the first place

to me, worth that money."
A1V8BSIQV28GRA_2040,I saw this as a child and loved it. Now as an adult I still feel the same way. Such a great movie I had to add it to my DVD collection.
AKKAJ6ND7O3BS_13624,Entertaining movie and enjoyable.  Safe for the entire family.  With the subject it could have been much more than it is.
A1BFE3PSY97MNB_15267,"I never liked this film. Plainly and simply put, it's terrible. Zep was never much of a live band, their best work was from the studio and Jimmy Page's technical genius."
A31MGQLJBB1NL6_17780,I loved this as a teen and thought it would be a great addition to add to my film collection. It is really dated and irksome. Bring on Frankie and Annette-much better.
A1Z031PB1BTNQX_10842,"It would have been good , but All that crazy dancing and goofiness was a waste , even though it starred Jimmy Stewert and Jean Arthur."
AH73L1LWT09MW_13356,I enjoyed the special effects much more with the hi def input. It changed the way I saw the explosions
AGCLG2LSPGT5X_13594,the rating on this movie should be changed to reflect the ratings today with the nudity and language is not appropriate for children very disappointed that they have not reflected this.
A2ZNMQU4IHIX49_2104,Always a treat! This ginger is a die-hard orphan with talent & the will to survive.  I loved this movie as a child & my children love it too!
A1B8KYG1W1744D_7010,my niece loved it she gives it 5 stars she loves scary movies the scary they are the better they are.
A22VNXHU6IZ5MT_23147,"Sad,sad,sad!!! What a great movie!!! But what a crappy DVD!!! SLP vhs tapes look better. A complete waste of money!!! This film deserves much better!!! YUCK!!!"
A11S3GCYA41FFJ_5007,Excellent movie! Enjoyed getting to watch with my kids because they really liked the story.
A2ZFCQ0FZB4Q0X_22739,The picture quality is very faded ... but its Laurel and Hardy doing their thing
A25KX167GZ89Q8_12551,"Great old Movie to watch on a Rainy day or late night still worth watching, makes you wonder what will happen the day that is does happen, hopefully not too soon."
A1B01Z2US27751_7577,I love this movie. Nothing about Flight plan I would change. Jodie Foster is a great actress and this movie shows just how well she can act.
A3PJBCGS3Q57NK_4942,An excellent film that handles delicate subject matter with respect but also realistically.  Rather ahead of its time.
A3EM32S9AYBZVA_4534,"I love, love, love this movie.  I cant decide which of the main characters I love the most.  They are all awesome in their own way.  This movie is so much fun!"
AJDER8726C78R_2640,A great film for Media Arts and Journalism. The film delves into the ethical issues surrounding journalism. A great resource for high school teachers.
AH16HVW3ZITR3_17699,"Not sure why this is a classic, didn't really appeal to me, but now at least I know about the leg lamp."
A1F3NSLXFEG3C1_10476,This was a good action movie with a lot of car chases and exciting twists. I would recommend it to anyone who likes action and adventure movies.
A2BTMUF359ZHZ5_11005,I like Christian movies but this one was really lame. It was slow and the acting was not all that convincing. I ended up turning it off. I don't recommend this movie.
A29DLF142BIESF_8903,The early Clint Eastwood was always in his best form in a Western.  No exception here.
APF6DFB57SML0_7683,"Lady and the tramp, except that the lady is a hooker, and the tramp is into gerbils."
A1DJF4SCY6U165_9362,"Another movie classic filmed originally in B/W,this version colorized. Enjoy viewing B/W classics colorized-when opportunity offers itself!"
A34W7QA4J5UTOR_2538,Great science fiction film!  I enjoyed the thoroughly creative storyline.  It's an intriguing and unique vision of the future.  I've seen the film several times and never been bored.  Jude Law gives a wonderfully convincing performance.
A40SNIPBE5G81_14413,"Bureaucratic office thriller masquerading as WWII bomber film.  If Gregory Peck chewed out a shirker today as he lashes Hugh Marlowe, he'd be prosecuted for bullying"
A3GU1VT7VNGOVU_8998,"It may be a classic or something, but I just don't get it. To each his own...I love plenty of movies other people think are total cr@p."
A1Q10EL9TP5NP7_7839,We think it was a great movie. Have watched it a number of times still makes me smile and laugh. It has a good ending. Wish they would make the next one.
A3VAF83VTO9EPR_20537,Really time to do another series of the Stand. Sorry to offend any die-hard King fans. But this is way too outdated to enjoy..
A1NT4CEYTAVF1E_15879,An 80's cheeseball of a film about wax museum figures coming to life in a world of their own.
A39XR5AGD60YKT_17081,"Not terribly entertaining, unless you are a sycophantic moron liberal that only likes poorly constructed caricatures of Christians (which are typically sex crazed adulterous hypocrites) and moron veterans."
A2BDAZEFU4DU43_9086,"I know people love this movie, but I just didn't quite get it - I had to watch it for a film class. Is it because I'm female? Do you have to be a guy to appreciate this film?"
A289MVW87BI88R_20894,"Lots of fluff, not much substance, fun at times, and you REALLY have to suspend disbelief.  I like Heilee Steinfeld and she made it a 3 star instead of 2.  Cute movie."
ABK09TXQ0KNNU_8101,A fun movie except I wish they had left out the part of Lilo playing with voo-doo dolls.  The music is great and the characters are delightful!
A28ALDON4DD2BY_8493,"Every time you watch it.  Kevin Costner has been given a gift of classic
American charm.  He should use it more."
A3OC6XWQBWGUCT_14747,"A great, large scale musical worth seeing again.  While the music, outside of Hello Dolly sung by Louis Armstrong, is not that memorable, it is worth seeing just for the late 1800's wardrobe and set design."
A12O47TBZRD152_15554,scary and wonderfully acted by  patty  mccormack........sends chills when you see it for the first time.  would have preferred another actress than  NANCY KELLY....but she was ok......a little too theatrical.  love the ending after movie is over
A19ZEEZTGIXUOL_5215,"This was a movie my daughter-in-law loved as a child.  I was glad to find as a DVD, so that she can share it with her children.  Great movie.  I still enjoy watching it with the grandkids as well."
A3HHP2JMX89732_14611,"Oh, yeah, Michael Douglas was in this.  Sometimes I forget when I think about Kathleen Turner."
A2Y897CK0F76VT_17952,been long time since I've seen this movie  i rent it before buying it in dvd and i was  disappointed i thought there was more action
A8IC4AYQRG3SV_13983,"Too late for Noir. Tired story with a decent twist at the end. Lupino is OK, but the others are leaden. More Cold War Morality than true Noir angst. It's free, so watch it and forget it, if you must."
ARKDD0ZWY77QI_16540,"Love old black and white movies with actors like Bela Lugosi. Although somewhat grainy and sound isn't the best, it is still a classic B horror movie and fun to watch!"
A3RYU38JT3TKY_20075,dvd was in spanish and not playable in region 1.  return was very well handled.
A3Q2EQLLLQOQXI_14502,Too predictable.  A little silly and trite in parts.  Too many stupid moves to be believable.
AACJUD2Y4DXWV_10397,Was a pretty good movie to pull up to the couch with a bowl of popcorn.
ATEQOAUMIPQ5U_19511,It was so boring and nothing new. I could only watch a couple of mins. before I got rid of it.
A2F42D9XNVTM37_18314,"Good Bautista film and not so good Smart film. Just another film trying to
Lead us to feel sorry for bad people.
Get real and know that when you make bad choices you have bad results.
Reap what you sow."
A3LQ3ZN205A042_17404,"This was a long drawn out, very predictable, story line that seemed to go on forever. The gratuitous sex scenes had no real relevance to the story."
A2G529HPM12K3T_21875,DVD wasn't in the best shape. It was frustrating for my kids who are all under 8 to watch the movie when it would skip or stop playing altogether. I feel that the DVD was not represented accurately.
A25L5YZNUZHON6_15225,"Recently noticed that Black Widow was added to Amazon Prime and was really looking forward to watching this gem today.  Unfortunately, the video (yes, going back I noticed the 1987 Release Year) is the Debra Winger version.

Signed,

Disappointed"
A1JIWG8NOZXBI4_4369,What war is really like !!! J.D. Salinger was there and so was the beginnings of The Catcher in the Rye. Read the book and watch the movie.
A94YE657KXATV_14957,"I have a few John Wayne movies, I'm not a big fan like some in my family. I've seen this movie a few times on TV and wanted it for my collection. Simple as that."
A13S8UK2JVP52O_3976,"This is a movie that you must own, You will never see a movie like this again so buy it now."
ATJF5QEVNMWIL_8165,"After many lackluster Disney films(Pocahontas, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Hercules, Mulan, The Emperor's New Groove, and  Atlantis: The Lost Empire), they are back with a great one. One of their Best!"
A28N4YIJPBJDFK_18265,"I really enjoy these movies, the paint can was an unneeded feature, I only got it because it was cheaper"
A1CE48O15OIQ09_1645,It is a very bad movie about Joan of Arc.  Most of it is fiction.
A2CJGRYHRRSV91_15222,Good mystery with a surprise ending.  Had seen it once before and forgot how it ended so I decided to purchase it.
A1AWYFJ2VCVSNT_16972,"Okay, it's a classic, but I liked the first one the best.  Great Scott! Gets a bit old after awhile"
A3B9XTIDLP6BKN_22803,A policeman battles a terrorist in a battle of wills and knowledge as the policeman aspires to figure out what the terrorist aspires to accomplish in a chase/race through NYC.
AY4ES7PP8RIIA_5763,"I really love this movie it is a classic movie and even though I bought it used, it still works great."
A1SNNPH6OHAFES_7170,"The movie is great but this copy did not play. It made a crazy noise and just did not play!
I am terribly disappointed!"
A133JP50JLSPGE_13931,"Stupid

I enjoy the movie. But it okay...he's a little stupid the way he acts toward other people, A Feelings of shy...mixed with chemicals to change his behavior, how silly it is and stupid the way he act..."
A3DAL3KO3W0IQ4_3492,"For those who like drugs/sex/alcohol & guns this is a must see
For those who like Johnny Depp - Great Acting"
A2F3AA798D6X5H_181,"This movie is so great! This film shows a different side of Jesus, a wonderful side. It was a whole lot better than the other ""Jesus"" films...."
AJ5I39GJSGSZW_22532,They took an excellent story and threw it into the gutter.  Violence is one thing but continual gutter language and crass sexual content added nothing to a very good movie and in fact made it sickening.
A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H_21497,"A lot of this movie is aimed towards kids, compared to the first film, and it really shows. But still, the turtles going back in time was something different and new. Overall, this may not be the best Ninja Turtles movie, but it's ok."
APDTAXWCCVZ9Y_4835,"Remember this movie growing up, and  had to reread the book for a High School English Class."
A81UQY2JL2F6A_7994,Great movie for the whole family to watch together- not too many like that out there any more.
AY0SXR54BB3AK_13095,Classic gang war film from a lost era. It is quintessential 70's. I would love for Quentin Tarantino to do a remake of this great and highly underrated film.
ADOQRCR2S5JN1_16199,Really bad plot. I was there and nothing like like that ever happened and the acting sucked.
A1Y8PDZ7T8R5TJ_12582,"Some poor sound... really just the music and at times a little unclear picture. But the film has a great plot and Bronson is at his best as a tough but caring hero, well worth having for any Bronson fan........."
AO3ZVS2A1SZ3Y_22818,"My title says it all...no subtitles!! My Spanish is not adequate. But even if it were, the soundtrack was deplorable."
A2K4RJQXY8O7DE_6371,"I think this is my favorite of the Universal Monsters,  it is just so good.  Boris Karloff is awesome.  What an underrated actor!  Zita is great too.  This is just a classic that stands up under repeat viewings."
A2JRDJWXWA1NN9_18863,"I do not hate this film , I just hate that I couldn't get it to play on my PS3 . I believe this to be a region B blu-ray only ."
A2V0J0ZOHG9RSE_20636,I was not impressed and my granddaughter didn't like it.  It is a play and not cartoon.  Seemed very slow in getting to the story.
A3W3KWL2WD6JQD_13580,Being a fly on the wall of Imperial Russia and witnessing  the autocrats being completely detached from the masses while facing the napoleonic dark clouds engulfing the old traditional oligarchy.  I enjoyed it immensely.
A1TG1KJPWXDO9E_14923,Basically this movie its just like Gappa same storyline but different setting and plots. Basically a parent looking for its infants and destroying building and all to get it.
A2S6QK4YIGWL0F_2386,This movie is one I could have done without. It a few good moments but despite the good actors it left one wanting.
ABYCK8DCE71UP_20030,"If everything in the entertainment world were related to the Kardashians except The Last Outlaw, well, go ahead, give Mickey a chance."
AM0GX20YOSP4K_15569,Early example of a serial killer in the making! Scary isn't it! Watch it and see for yourself!
A2YAJKQCKAAAM2_8023,Love this movie. My kids grew up on it and now my grandkids. This movie was when Muppets were not PC and the jokes were funny. The message was follow your dreams and enjoy the journey
A1VKSVNY347N4X_1514,Action packed sequel.  If your are wondering what happened after see got out of the hospital watch this movie.  It has more characters and events that explain the aftermath.
A14MML8W9SBEP9_800,I loved this movie and it's all star cast.  Have watched it over and over.
AMK4AVNUCPUIT_4828,A classic of course and well worth the purchase. Can be watched over again in a couple years and lent to those who haven't seen it.
A1TK6JWUC26FK1_6525,"Riveting, brilliant example of 70s film making. One of Friedkin's best and least appreciated. The Blu-Ray does right by this masterpiece."
A133XWRV6JITQ2_7361,I originally had this on VHS and wanted to replace it on DVD. Love the movie
A1YGBQCCW19LA4_10171,"Not as good as I hoped it would be.  Although Ann-Margret and Elvis had a very close relationship, it just didn't leave me with the good feeling that his other movies did."
A13PJS89H5XTW4_22046,"WE DID NOT ENJOY THIS MOVIE...IT WAS TOO LONG, TOO UNINTERESTING, DOWNRIGHT BORING....THE FIRST TWO-THREE PRODUCTIONS OF BOUNTY WERE FAR BETTER...."
A3RJ49RHZ352BS_7696,Thanks for getting it to me on time and as described.  Gotta Love great black classics
A1F9Y503N0S32E_3060,I have enjoyed Demi Moore since one of her earliest movies Chicago. I have followed her movies since that time. Striptease was a classic for her dance and beautiful looks just like Chicago.
A3L6Z4ZV8QBGI6_10983,"once Obama was re-elected? America is fed up with ""Obama Hatred Syndrome"". We're tired of it. Please stop doing this to America"
A3RX5CGOCXJMGF_20291,"From old VHS tape to DVD - really poor quality - very dark - faded color -
Come on you're owned by the News Corporation - Rupert Murdock could sure give some of his zillions and restore these wonderful films."
A1YHOUOOQW6BLF_20740,Poor production of Louis Lamour 's Hondo story.  John Wayne was typical John Wayne so enjoyed despite production.
A1VKT76YHR83C6_21753,"Slow start----leaned heavily on earlier West world including Yul Brenner-----finally 1/2 way through film, started to develop a newer, more sinister reason for Futureward----should have started sooner,"
A319F9CZSEWUSX_16890,"Unfortunately, we watched the original ""Beaches"" the day before we watched this one. Of course the original was much better."
AY69Y202QP8ZH_9299,"This not a movie review, I'm collecting old movies, obviously it's one that I like.  Vendor shipped quickly."
A112EXGPYBT397_2778,I enjoy this movie it really has a good massage in the move. if you like kid and play give this movie a shot.
A2NY3D8E7TEDF5_21589,"I've definitely saw better movies with either actor in it. Robin Williams is way over the top, and Walter Matthau seemed uninterested in his role in the movie..."
A3IF76O0VUMVYZ_5560,"This is one of my daughter's favorite movies and watched it 4 times I think so far.  For older teens, not young kids."
A2PBAEZUER27GT_15505,"First of all, not a fan of nature films. If you like nature film, then you'll probably like it. The 6 year old like the film a great deal more, but she did say there were too many snakes."
A36KJYYXDMG4E7_16750,"""Hell is For Heros"" is a well made movie.  The story is good and McQueen and the other actors do a good job.  It is not exceptional.  I like ""The War Lover"" better."
A243GUOTNUF2VN_7002,IF YOU LIKE A GOOD MYSTERY TIED TOGETHER WITH A PARANORMAL HAUNTING YOU WILL ESPECIALLY ENJOY THE PERFORMANCE OF GEORGE C. SCOTT IN THIS MEMORABLE MOVIE. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
A3L47VHIWOKGFL_22138,this version came out on the dark side for the night scenes.  still a great movie.  thought I was buying a dvd but for the price vhs is good enough
A2NU9H8H5MJZSL_14488,"The blu-ray is underwhelming to say the least.  It is no improvement over DVD played with upscaling.

Grain...lots of it as if you are looking through constant haze.

Poorly placed subtitles ruin the picture.

Pass on this blu ray."
AWAVLO8RZLNRX_14476,"It's a war classic.  If you like trains, and who doesn't, Ole Blue Eyes will make it worth your while."
AAJU4SG0NX7P_15236,"Great movie showing both the music & their developing as a group. Also, look
at films on The Yardbirds to see what took place for Yardbirds to become
members of other bands, i.e. Led Zep"
A3EKQV7J4GE13R_10559,"A simple statement about the thin veneer of civilization, and the superstitious gullibility of the human race in general which leads to religious zealotism, murder, and mayhem. A most excellent film."
A3SVDGKBTH0XKF_21453,Did not like this one at all ... the actors lacked passion for the work they were doing ... camera work wasn't that great either.
A2XN0BVF9M5GDU_19879,"I purchased this video because of others recommendations however I regret having wasted my money. The quality is bad, the script is weak and the entire moving was boring."
A3E0NT7F8MT5MK_19004,the best thing about this movie  is clovis the cat and the lady who played the mom acting
A3F3ZKYC8WVYG_14086,Nothing deep or heavy here. Just the exploration of a shallow teenager developing into more maturity in funny ways. A relaxing watch.
A3ZMH7JYQL590_6887,"What a stupid movie. It was a cross between a comedy and horror and failed at both. Good thing it was free with amazon prime, I'd have been pissed if I had to pay for it"
A29GTEMN0C0WBN_9401,"This film would have been far better WITHOUT Sondra Locke, she is a waste of skin in front of a camera. Never the less, its a simple tale well told."
AOA2M9XI2XFYQ_9957,Great movie and it looks great on blu-ray. The only complaint I have is there are NO special features. No commentary or behind-the-scenes. Usually the blu-ray has that over the dvd version. Oh well.
A3AKTNMH6TMCQA_13,"Found ""An American Christmas Carol"" to be enjoyable. In my opinion, it didn't rise to the level of the film versions of the Dickens Christmas Carol, but it was worth watching."
A9AIF6NPEZTQA_17954,"Classic, just good enough to make into my collection.  Probably because the cast of actors were seasoned vets."
A1FZA28KKEK8MT_13306,"This is a classic and probably the best of the original movies. The introduction of Savak is a nice twist from the original characters.  Bringing back Kahn, obsessed, proves to be his downfall.
Bad guy almost wins..."
A17ZLLUYLS1YYO_9861,This movie is so sick.  They rate it PG13 and there's so much dirty content in it.  This director should have stayed with aliens.  Oh well.
A112R6YSMWMSAI_18648,IF you like Sub films or a James Garner fan get it. If you are judging this film objectively then give it a pass.
A1HTTDII8F1G38_20169,its a shame he died his characters and his acting were fun and different as festor he played a great role that was funny and niece
A1GWGOYPVE7CN_5702,Awesome.  Classic.  Just one of those movies you should have in your collection.  I have watched it several times since I received
A2GIBFKJS5FXKX_22194,"Rebecca does topless in the film. There are no full frontals in the film. She is fully nude in the film, but never a full frontal. Always side or rear"
AXSND3JLJCYRU_12423,"This is a period piece right out of the 1960s, with some very well known faces.  Entertaining, and reminds us of how far we have come since then."
A1H1IXCZ3MEGHB_21788,Hadn't seen this movie in years. Love the product and received it in a timely manner. I always enjoy watching movies I grew up watching
A1BPZ7O7PQR90N_13777,"Fun movie from the past.  In all it 80's hoakyness, I enjoyed spending my time watching it again"
AEMB56DP217EY_6286,"A little vulgar at times for a cheap laugh, but okay.  It's that kind of movie where you are left saying ""if only if they had put this in the story"" or ""if only they had left that out."""
A3H6PKSSFXDIS2_4170,This is an excellent WWII motion picture...no discussion here of any of the details so as not to spoil anything for the viewers.  Do you want to see a good quality WWII flick...then watch this one.
A1NRQTK270CA0J_18166,"It had a good a premise but it just didn't hold my interest.  Disappointing, since I really like Casper Van Dien."
A15Y85N9328LCI_9688,"Love the special effects. Disappointed with the unhistorical flourishes. There is no record of any of the Titanic's Officers blowing his brains out. ""A Night to Remember"" is a much better story, even if the special effects are inferior."
AHUT55E980RDR_22846,"HOPEFULLY, THEY'LL READ THIS BEFORE POSTING AND THERE NOT POST IT
Not a good serial...read my more detailed review.  I'm just writing this to clear it off the list of items they don't think I've reviewed."
A3HEV3I13Q2SWJ_13185,I dislike movies that denigrate sex and the human encounter. Chose to not finish watching it.
AX5B2FUZW5Z55_10688,"Very Nostalgic.  The effects didn't get that much of an ""upgrade"", you can tell CGI/Green Screen in the film, but if you grew up or are a fan of the original trilogy like me, then you'll like this."
A3C9DUWL6YWOOC_13382,Charles Bronson was cranking these out just for the money without any real substance to this movie and his many others. Don't waste your time or money
A3762LB4P78A09_21852,"Which version is this, you have a photo of Brando and a poster with Lancaster."
A10QM4UZIAO7UZ_10134,"One of my favorite films from my youth, Poltergeist is still entertaining after all these years. "
A3Q0RDVFPO1XZU_16617,I didn't really care for this movie. I didn't find it cheery at all and I didn't like the ending. I like happy endings. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend to buy.
AW1Q0ZMGD7MB1_9840,"Tea is hot as always.  Robert Duvall does what he has so often done, turns a so-so movie into a good one.  His portrayal of the veteran astronaut is priceless."
A1FBS4LTCPPUOQ_4083,"Daniel Day-Lewis gives a convincingly authentic portrait of Christy Brown.  It is wonderful to watch him work!
Great story-great performance!"
A2HUVJBMVIG9LC_23595,"It's old ... It's dated ... It's really a ""B movie"" ... BUT ... if you like watching Charles Bronson, then don't let that stop you.  I enjoyed it for what is was and I always enjoy watching Bronson work."
A2XW6HWLV3L822_10286,liked the movie could not pass it up when it was on blu-ray and this is a good way to add to a collection.
AZPSZ9N45589_20419,"I think people may be mixing this up with White Fang- I did!  This movie was just idiotic.  I gave it 2 stars because Spacey made it (barely)  watchable.  But without Spacey, it's nothing."
AQ6SV7LDSMGBE_10819,"...I still wish you could get these films restored as seen in 1977 (and so.)  I don't mind the re-makes so much, but I miss the originals and my VHS tapes are wearing out."
A30OANCZ0UXC90_21765,"Not one of Meg Ryan's best. The exaggerated and preposterous plot undoes the efforts of the great actors involved. However, Walter Matthau does do a very entertaining impression of Einstein.  That is perhaps the best thing this movie can offer."
A1307VV615KQ64_2292,"Great movie. Monty Pythos's best, I think. I love British humor. The best part is the French guy telling them off."
A1L915K3WX4K29_14132,thought this was a waste of time. I could do without her political stances and views and disrespect of veterans.
A26CD9190JO5ZE_11934,"A Great Musical, Classic!!!  My Mom has Alzheimers and it really puts a smile on her face and she knows a lot of the songs or hums.  Fantastic..."
A3MLE9W9YYVGBT_6456,"This is a very funny DVD to watch with your family, You will laugh and cry but you will be happy you bought it"
A21P23BGVPDB_21975,"This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched.  Thought an ""oldie"" Mel Gibson movie might be a ""goody"".  No way.  I do not recommend this movie"
ARKQOF1RUMPL6_22506,I thought i had seen all of James Bond films but i realized i had not seen this classic one till i got watching it i really thought it was pretty good I would watch it again
A1JSDHQH49LJLA_17643,"Not my favorite version, but well worth watching.  Those modern special effects are not all bad.  I found the acting a bit stiff for modern times."
A1P0VW7IXUNUM2_17036,"someone recommended this flicks because or the coal mind setting
however it deals very little to that culture
narrative story boring"
A23M34LR1SQHS9_55,"One of the better remakes of A Christmas Carol, plus Henry Winkler does the part justice.  He is very believable in this roll."
ASPDHQKTO35BX_14288,Not going to even mention the crazy idea in this movie. Not Chevy's usual National Lampoon's character.
A2SEUIJM2QWACT_23225,"Movie plot is fine, but the quality really, really sucks. This film is dying...either restore it or trash it!"
A2LOIXUGIRVS08_1454,"Loved the movie. Wanted to add to my library, so did, at a very reasonable price.. I am adding more words so will have 20, although I have nothing else to say. Stupid rule."
A11F3YONMF67ML_8346,This is such a classic Disney movie. I loved this movie as a little girl and loved watching classic Disney movies when I would go stay at my grandparent's and can't wait for my little ones to watch it.
A15CCQLICLK4KF_6228,Reason for viewing -- simple -- Julia Roberts.  Reason to stop viewing -- simpler -- boring.
A25VFK1S9QONNE_18893,"Just skip this captain america movie. The acting is more like the old power-rangers tv series, than a 1940's era hero."
A2VCUW5IG6KFAI_12622,"A very entertaining movie.  John Wayne in a different light. He is clever and in an interesting way,  very modern."
AI7I0J9ZCPOK1_3789,"I Love this movie. Now I can watch it year around. Great for the family, IT IS A WONDERFFUL LIFE!"
A32MD5AZKA21QW_16758,"This item was received in record time and came in perfect condition. Its a really nice movie, the kind they don't make any more."
A2MJTV5168YVT4_19864,"Small sci-fi film from the 50tys .Well done stop motion dinosaurs , Actors are all believable  , just a fun film. Not to long but gets their point across."
AHSF06670DDN8_14299,"Good acting and a decent screenplay lead the watcher on a trip to the dark side again.  This film is entertaining,  and although it lacks the nuances and subtleties of the original,  it is still a great 80's film."
AWMXL51X9D7C5_10278,It's a sad story but there are uplifting parts. The music is classic and wonderful. I have seen it before but not for a long time.
A2KC1AHZ50E4DX_11327,Saura is always very good at stories about the world of dance and this one is a real must for those who admire flamenco.
A3B9XTIDLP6BKN_14239,A story about a bunch of people on a train. A guy ends up dead so a detective goes about aspiring to figure out who did the deed.  He concludes that everyone could have done it. Engaging suspenseful tale.
A8C1IQZE5LM36_19548,"It's a good movie, but I was sort of disappointed with Glenn Ford here, a bit of a lack luster performance."
AO1AWE3A86XD9_3552,Disappointed cos you advertisement the DVD as widescreen when the format on the case said it is  FULL SCREEN on both dvd
A3JYYY7NXWT6HE_1253,"Movies like this are a disgusting tribute to the filth and perversion that seems to be prevalent in our major cities.  I wish I could ""unsee"" it."
A39D17AJ08YJWM_8698,"True story of racial hatred, courage and sacrifice. It is sad that many people today still feel the same way, though they may not act accordingly. However, this movie portrays true heroics and Ving Rhames shines in an early role."
A1ECIKAFT7Y5T2_19024,Some parts were funny and clever yet other were hard to get through because they were pretty dull.  Some nice cameos from some stars of the era.
A26KPN5E87WMM6_5851,"Brilliant and as with most foreign remakes by Hollywood, in a different league than dinner with Schmucks."
A6I8QO7TEDQ4C_8559,"I had not seen this movie in years, It was ok. Jack Nicholson was very good in this movie. I think he is a little crazy anyway."
A2ZMGIE78SAVD4_3779,"A ""must see"" ....a great portrayal of what to be thankful for in your life and not always looking and/or comparing yourself w/ ""what others have"" ..which is not what is best for you in your life ..."
A271TR81FUN8SX_904,Very good product in VHS. However buyers beware of this title in DVD. I purchased 2 from different sellers and the sound was missing on both.
A2DICRMS7SQIZD_10851,"Dark comedy and some very good subtle humor, and Peter Sellers does an amazing job in two roles in the film.  Other than that, not worth the time."
A3IBCPYXC6GK39_17570,Unfortunately I did not notice it was coming from Germany and I can't watch it because it is designed to only work in Europe.
A2CBF1Z7L9RZLB_22266,I chose this rating because I flat out didn't like it.  Too much abuse.  The only part I liked was at the end of the movie.
A2DE5UPQJSIPKR_13096,"Priceless, timeless comedy. This movie never grows old.  Akroyd and Murphy keep you constantly entertained. Such a wonderfully funny movie."
A7RL65DAZY6I8_16692,"Ok if you like old campy horror, which I do.  It's actually based on something that happened to someone.  I'm not sure how much of it is the truth though. But, it's a horror movie what can we expect?  Ha!"
A2D24PPZ0JCMJ8_21020,Did not like the profanity coming from children's mouths.  The adults were bad enough.  Did not watch but a few minutes of this trash.
A13VQOO2P9EBSS_11506,"Wow, everything you wanted to know but were afraid to ask. Mature audiences only please."
A3I8CCGV713P4X_9146,"one of the greatest cinematic achievements in the field of sci-fi, this film definitely deserves it's status as a masterpiece. A must-see for every fan of the genre."
A3MYDI7979V6LU_2274,"THIS COMES IN 3RD, BEHIND THE MEANING OF LIFE (1ST), AND LIFE OF BRIAN, STILL GOOD, THOUGH.  IT'S JUST THAT THE RIDING AROUND W/O HORSE GETS OLD QUICK, FOR ME...I STILL LIKE IT."
ADNBUKNODH7OX_9129,"Second time to see this movie. Enjoyed it because of the unusual plot, but nevertheless it was an old movie."
AWU6S35EXAWWC_10756,"This is a total rip-off price hike, in stores it ranges from 39.99 to 52.99 for the box set on dvd including the bonus disc.  I love the trilogy, but the price made me sick."
AF6F60X82R993_13056,"It made me laugh.  He was a man that wanted a serious relationship, and could not make up his mind who was going to fill the bill."
A3HOZFJE69MOVA_6328,"Love this movie! Funny, romantic and well cast. We use quotes from this movie all the time. And the soundtrack is fabulous."
A2GJCAACXMF00B_21627,"There is a problem with the DVD, I am  not sure as yet if it just needs to be cleaned are I need to replace it!"
A3EVSJ149XQESS_775,Incredible movie with both sad and funny parts.  The acting is superb!  Love seeing all of these blockbuster actresses together in one film.
A1LH9IKD5YIYIW_7304,"Newly remastered, and what I believe is one of Arnold's best, intelligent action flicks, this was a great purchase. Forget the new reboot, it does not even come close to the action that this original delivers!"
A37TG7VOX2KTOM_7457,"You know that I like Doris Day too much if this movie as not like the best of her , but it's enough to look to Doris Day ,she is only one ."
A9GPYIQFT2O3F_10000,better than I remember.  still has awful music but I had completely forgotten the gay aspect - I think Richard Gere must have been at least a little brave to risk his hetero heartthrob reputation by taking on this part.
A23H4KU24QJ2B_11457,"Beautiful exotic scenery etc. ...more like an R rated contemporary film ...kind of twisted and harsh in places ... a shame, as it could have been so much better."
A2USQQQBR5CBS7_15083,Another marvelously stoical-whiny performance by Alan Arkin and James Caan as the perfect tough guy partner for it make this a classic from when both actors were at their best.
A2BKIPIJWR6V04_6539,Was a good movie. Wasn't what I expected from the title. Poor guy that got shot in the back of the head was the only somewhat normal person in the bunch. A lot of irony in this movie.
A3DVF8B947F01L_7288,"Have always loved this movie, finally decided to just order it for my wife and myself."
A1JMP7ZJ8YUJIA_15423,"A mediocre film, but the music and the cinematography are top rate. In total, the setting (I know, it's not authentic new England ocean),

Legrand's tune, and the filming produce an unforgettable summer impression and mood."
AEIGGK6HLOD96_1268,"It was good and interesting, obviously a very early and raw Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson creation. Good movie for a taste of their early work."
A2WMRKPJTZRLAH_12535,Rock Hudson at his comedic best.  Love the story line and all the characters.  Good addition to my oldies collection.
AL5IHGWKYBIQM_3542,A real family film especially for Christmas. It is as enjoyable to watch today as it was the first time I ever saw it. I would highly recommend.
A5VDSOQQC2HVL_22979,"When you realize how much has been distort and this murder never got caught. He murder five people, those he attached eight people. This film glories people like this, who should have been shot or hanged back then."
ARO7VFY4CBGRI_5216,THIS IS A VERY FUNNY MOVIE. How funny. there's a dog named shithead. and steve martin. who is very funny. the opening is a riot.
A1CRUOC2MQT0AZ_8742,A fast moving story that gives a sense of the times it is about...great acting...well written...very long...but worth the time watching it.....
A3C4VSLX0MHEQC_8131,"My 7 year old granddaughter is really ""into"" Lilo & Stitch"".  She loves their adventures and is captivated by her favorite personalities as she sees them on the screen."
AA2B4KQC9BE5J_21951,"Nice photography, but the story is not true. Independent research shows that MacArthur never gave an order to destroy cavalry horses. It should have been billed as ""fiction"" rather than ""based on a true story""!"
A1TXU309DV96DC_13491,"I like the movie. It had campy production values but was a neat story. However, they did not come up with a satisfying ending. At least not to me."
AXLIZPL4HP8NI_10885,"I find this story humorous even though the subject is dark, its a farce with a ring of truth."
A2U67M7SVQVM9V_5877,"It's complete crap, really bad. I watched the Bill Murray pic, ""where the buffalo roam"" and liked it. This Depp interpretation on Hunter S. Thompson is unlikable, unbelievable and sophomoric at best."
A1OI540AHBXVT6_812,Came fast and was as advertised.  It was for my wife for her birthday and she loves it.  I would def recommend this classic.
AKK9M8UPFPLZE_13510,Really bad! Set in the 30's and costumed with the 60's. Even the music was 60's. And the story was inaccurate .Blech.
A2OW1XECCXHFC5_5801,My son loved the first Babe movie but was not interested in this one at all!
ATT5G1ATF34J_5324,The interaction between John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn is outstanding!  I like that she always manages to get the last word!
A3CL3CKONZDA7U_7757,By now-everyone should recognize my frugality. I hate to pay a lot!!! This movie is such a high-demand item; they never lower the price on it! So glad to catch it while I could.
A2332DDKWXEC5J_5064,One of the best movies and acting performances of all time. Fantastic and raw look into our countries past. One of my favorites for sure
A1EU66488BUQC2_20337,"Animation is ok at best. Storyline is decent.
Worth buying but definitely not a 4-5 star movie.
Picked it up because I remembered fragments from my childhood."
A2DDH9Y61DIU4P_13316,"It is an old sci Fi that is OK. What do you want, interesting story but acting is laughable."
A1GWWORTKFD1H7_18346,The extended cut added a bunch more stuff about the witch.  I preferred the original.
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_11589,"Boring B-movie almost comical, a evil guy comes from 1691 and a guy comes from then too to stop him. a yawn of a movie."
A6RB1O0JPPOA0_3368,"Jon Wayne, do I have to say more?  Wayne and his ""family"" of actors portray the US Calvary's actions during the Indian Wars.  Vintage Wayne and worth the price of admission."
A196VU49UCIOQT_21854,Have wanted this video for quite awhile.  It was new in the box and was just as described.  Very happy with my purchase.
ADX56E3E09XZE_8176,Late in replacing VHS library with some of the classics. Glad to find the dvd at such a great price!
AOR4BEPUPLQ1_22349,Silly psychodrama utopian BS captain compared to first Trek series. Good supporting cast especially the 1st officer role
ADPB8S493PYGE_6883,"As degenerate as it gets.....It didn't have to be but a lack of motivation, purpose and believable performances would have helped.
America continues it's odd fascination with violence ....I don't get why..."
AM68L114XLCD_11724,So very sad that this wasn't more exciting.  I'm glad I rented it instead of purchasing.  Its too bad...I was looking forward to an interesting film on the subject.
A33NW7SHZWFEAO_1307,"I never heard of this movie before until I selected it, and it's a pretty good one.  Good acting, awkward story.  It won't win an Oscar but it's an amusing watch."
A1BIKE0W9E1XLO_11948,"This DVD is OK, at least it is wholesome. It is a good portrayal about keeping commitments and being honorable."
A2TM61DU6W2CEC_10101,"In a way, I liked it. A careful elaboration of the character of an accomplished evil, an exploration how deep the vice and the greed can lead."
A2EQRK5VKWY4UL_1370,A true classic. This one is way better than any remake and its better than part 2. Love it!
A3DZS0Q4FYKO5M_4176,Love this movie. Have not seen it in years. Saw it with my daughter. Would watch it again and again
ADPZ5HXP5B3N_14083,Redford and Fonda acted well together. The plot was an little slow at times. Jane has amazing legs!
A1K2FP6W37L1WW_4852,I saw this ages ago and wanted it to keep. If you like Patsy Cline you will love this movie.
A5QE86H97FDJA_18105,This film was not funny. It was not campy. It was just bad. Stay far away from it.
A55DWAFXRTZXG_19087,"It a shame, that it was in Long Paying speed. Making it no so clear.  ART"
ADD68RRL8H3B5_12098,"I like this movie because it is nostalgic. The Brit's have made many well done monster movies and this one proves it, because there has been two remakes of it and this one is still the best."
A2W9J1ZCL5N1ZB_1180,i liked this one because it had a lot more violence. This one was definitely more scarier than the first one. The first one was just more of a mystery. This one is horror. I loved every minute of this
A2G1ZSQM0FN3VX_17877,"Now that I've seen it, I wonder what all the hype is about. It's OK, but not something that I would see again."
ACFR1D9UTCGLI_4884,If you like country music this is a must have.  There will never be another singer like her.  It is such a warm and heartbreaking story of her short life.
A1U6P8WNQQZVF0_22643,"This had such great potential. The last 30 minutes...ugh.... Why? Why? Why? Such a great cast, such a great story and then YUK. Colin Firth deserved better than this..."
A2U3HG214VNP9N_2465,"Excellent movie!  Spoiler Alert!  The best scene is near the end when the brothers confront each one final time.  They go for their final competitive swim and the main character states: ""I never saved anything for the swim back."""
AIIAI6BGKNESW_23808,The Innocents was very interesting all the way through until the end. A bad ending can and did ruined the movie.
AE3SC1KGTRWPL_316,one of the best movies I've ever seen. this DVD was grainier than the original movie.
A3FGBZCL7UM6W5_18379,"AWESOME movie, but the quality of this on Amazon video is hideous.  You can't hear any dialogue and our tv is new and we never usually have problems even with Amazon video."
AD0W97XLGJBFJ_14014,Horrible remake that even the powerhouse of actors in this film could not overcome.  The only mystery here is why they even made the attempt.
A3RBM6YWOFF4KT_23123,Was disappointed with this movie. I thought with the stars in it that it would have a much better plot and acting
A1KJC1J89UCTRA_18077,"Well filmed and adequately acted fantasy fun.  That, I suppose is the best you can expect of an adaptation of a comic strip.  Expect little and be pleasantly surprised."
A2S17FCUAOEIMY_14478,I bought this because I recently watched Romancing the Stone and wanted to see this older movie again but it is not near as good as Romancing the stone. I probably won't watch this one again.
A2MYAFZG6YP57C_5294,"Just fun to watch Wayne being Wayne.  Not the best story or the best acting for either, but fun if you are a fan of either him or Hepburn."
ANWI9SW3LW5PK_8583,This by far is the best vampire movie for me and will always be. No one does vampires like Anne Rice. I was very pleased with how quick my movie arrived and it was in great condition.
A5MOIZSWZMBTW_20876,I remember my 12 year old sister watching this movie when it first came out.  I was eleven years older and I did not think I would like it and I was right!
A1BVFJO7Y0JN28_4286,"This is not your typical war movie, but rather one that has a distinct message for the audience with superb acting and a story to go with it. I do highly recommend this film, although it may be somewhat disturbing."
A163KOMQTAMJH9_10929,"I love Jane Austin's Pride and Prejudice the most(my favorite book). That being said, Kate Winslet ruins this for me. She is tedious with her wailing."
A1UUC7JTSBUGWG_116,I really liked this version of Joseph in the Bible Collection. I bought the one in Bible Stories and it was ok but the movie is more down to earth to the events and follows scripture better.
AAVVPHV7ALEAY_1444,"I like the series. Somewhat predictable, and somewhat not predictable. And Milla Jovovich is in it."
A23V3BH5UHJNIE_9066,"This is a classic ,I remember it when 1st released . It's dated now w/o the flash/bang CGI but still a good Sci/Fi thriller ."
A2KKPXKD9NT6C4_23731,I loved it. when are you going to sale Gun smoke years 12 through 20?
A3C3OO82M3CDPT_20784,"I am a huge fan of Robin Williams. The acting was fine, the story line was not very good."
AZEU54NXF7SB5_3024,"Like it until the very end. The first 7/8ths of movie was indeed thriller, but the very end left us a bit non-pulsed."
A32YK790GT95AZ_1664,I loved this movie. The actress did a fantastic job depicting Joan of Arc. I will definitely see it again and again.
A17UCRKD80RUGT_8228,This season was the worst season so far of the show.  What a waste with the guy in the basement totally stupid. Not worth it!
A2P0G4L51V99GR_16008,"History should be remembered...this one is pretty close...not exact, but close. and, now I have to write nine more words that stinks."
A12BDG4M6L4RZU_16561,Boring! The youngest watched for a minute. The others stated they did not pick it so they should get to see something better.
A2P6J47LTJXFLI_8650,"A good production, needed some tightening up but overall recommended movie
based on the Carl Sagan novel."
A5IRNLYBGW3LB_20782,"This is a dumb movie but it's a b movie so if you like b films you must see it was told to me by a friend so I got  it I wish I had more to say about it,"
A3E82VXGEFJ7QI_22527,"Video quality terrible 3/4ths the size of my screen and grainy.  Love the flick though, wife says I have ovaries"
A3CLI4SHLUL50V_6671,Funny movie with Goldie Hawn and steve Martin.  Funnier than I thought it would be for an 80's movie.  Never really a dull moment. Moves at a good clip and a great laugh for lonely night or cheap date.
A3UQX2UXWLG090_11235,This movie deserved its best movie Oscar as well as best director Oscar.  The cinematography is spectacular.  The screenplay examines the Plains Indian culture and life in detail and without judgement.  This is a movie everyone should see.
A2B9NGZPJRM3BG_23514,with one clich&eacute; after another. Overwrought music. Peter Coyote seems miscast--not convincing as a writer or a lover or a rou&eacute;. Everyone overacts. The sex scenes lack authenticity. Not enough Kristin Scott Thomas. A mess.
A1Z9052AXKDLKA_6901,"I liked Mr Bale for sure in this one ... wild story and definitely a good movie.  I'm not sure I totally figured out what was really going on at the end, but have a good idea."
A7R00FX84YNGU_19819,"I like watching Chinese movies to understand thinking and culture, but this is typical of a Chinese movie in terms of real entertainment value.  It's another tragic story, so don't expect any feel-good vibes at the end."
A3FVMWJJPRE15U_9232,"It just goes to show you that...""You can't keep an old dog down.  It will get up and bite you!"""
A3HGBK331477GB_8924,I hate to see Morgan Freeman die in this movie. Gene Hackman was a horrible person and I think Clint Eastwood was fantastic; just kill them all as he did.
A136W35RIRXYAJ_5093,"This film was well done, but I hate sad endings that is why I can not rate this film very high, Not my kind of film,"
A1F04QD8CB718D_23847,Prompt service.  I just so disliked the movie.  Sorry to be so late to respond.  MKL
A1O18S5890ULZ7_3507,"loved it, it was a great price and came very quickly. You all always got what I want and need... thanks"
ATA4191XF55YF_3782,This is one of my all-time favorite Christmas movies and seeing it in Blu-Ray makes it even more special.  The original Black + White is my favorite but the included Colorized version is also interesting
A3C3OO82M3CDPT_8666,"Good actors with a clever story line that could have been done in 1/2 the time. IF you've got nothing better to do, watch this movie"
ADJ4M8X3UWSZF_4400,"Great movie.  Took forever to find it on dvd.  Starring Tony Randall, Barbara Eden and Burl Ives as the Jeannie."
AWF2S3UNW9UA0_3394,I don't watch western but this by John Ford is a classic.  You must see all ages good romance.
A25K41YKIK00OT_21737,"More Westworld lore, but not much more than that. Fun to imagine how it fits into the same universe as the HBO show."
A2NM0KPFGZPKUQ_9810,"If you're a fan of John Wayne and dig WWII/Navy movies, then you should give this movie a chance.  It's nothing super exciting.  It's just a movie that rekindles that feeling of true manhood frequently lost in modern culture."
A1HL0V61O8Q0JK_18173,Well wasn't expecti8ng much so it was pretty ok Movie.  Little low budget but entertaining.
AUTUYKL8525WP_21884,"Not exactly what I expected, darker and more gratuitous than I would normally watch.  The animation and action are well done though."
A1KRHFVSBUB366_256,"We have watched Arthur for years, so when I saw this on Amazon I knew I had to get it!"
A33FA68V0NCM5E_17332,"Some startling twists of plot, in addition to the odd witty one-liner,  enliven this otherwise ordinary tale of a maverick cop pitted against an  alien nemesis."
A1AL7GXFGTRB2W_21429,curiosity piece -- a film made by Penthouse publisher. Story violent and hard to see on small screen. But it is interesting to watch. is it collectible?
A1QW9QNI9DHEIK_20043,"The acting was good and the scenery was amazing.  The plot, however, was not very believable.  Worth the watch.....ONCE."
A3UGILCWBKAR1H_9912,"loved this when i was kid, but now its just bad. the first one its just so good though."
A11JDD2KZVUOT6_23053,"pretty good condition, although advertised as ""New"" it arrived and was definitely resealed and previously viewed, despite that it plays great andis just as I remember. Hilarious"
A38FH6CWWAOX7C_17800,"Movie was great ,as usual, but it was impossible to watch because it stopped and rebooted many times. I love amazon, but they have to fix there movie channel."
A3JBVNAT9ZQF1V_14358,Pretty good movie. Kept my interest. Never a dull moment. Interesting look back at history also. Great acting by George C. Scott in his role as Patton. Overall I thought it was done very well.
AC3XZYU40JG89_5169,"An odd plot line--but they make it work.  I don't think it is that well known, but I enjoy watching it from time to time."
A1T890K4I96E3A_9338,"Mike is great in this and the twist at the end, wow sure didn't expect that. Makes one think twice of making the wife angry."
ARX9I48V4EZAU_12108,"I bought this DVD at the ""99 Cents"" Store, I was hoping my kids and I would get a few laughs ... An Adam Richman Food Challenge would be easier to finish than this movie! ... save the 99 cents!"
A4U5CITC1JB05_8004,"An excellent flick! Cute, nice story, great use of movie artistry!
Why else would I buy it!"
A14AB8QXQ6J6H4_2254,My son lives watching elmo and at times I catch myself watching it and liking it too. It reminds me of bring a kid watching sesame street.
A130KZO1FFDTP8_11436,"Very good, but very depressing.  Excellent production, but be careful--you must like pensive mysteries with ""brutal"" fantasy themes, that are just too realistic!"
A2YA77O5RYQ1JE_4340,"For an HBO production it seemed pretty low budget. Didn't feel any real impact of that awful battle that, in the end, was deemed unnecessary."
A1DJLUH6JQ1RHQ_23687,Fun movie. But put out by a cheap Co.  The leave the CC & SDH off of it.
A2CXV46IV0WQ63_16576,"This is a very funny movie, Great story Great cast, Tony Danza at his best and I must say Ami Dolenz is very cute and funny. DVD Quality is Excellent too."
A3RO2KO4IGMII1_6984,Anyone looking for a good scary ghost story will not be disappointed with this 1979 release. The movie features a great performance by Mr. Scott and a very intelligent script
A1K4HYP5IQB9G9_17617,"I have always loved Whoopie, but found this movie dated and full of cliches. It was fun in it's day, but I ended up turning it off 15min into the film."
A16W8ANC7FD6ET_2400,"Worth a watch.  A tad slow at times. But overall enjoyable.  It was amusing seeing how old the electric ""cars of the future"" looked."
A3TOAOWG9KDSFG_3276,"this was bought for my husband, he saw it when it first came out and requested it, he really enjoys it"
AOYV6YF6HWAC5_18448,"Grandkids couldn't even sit still for it; work up to the smurfs was so long we weren't sure it was labeled right.  Dull, boring."
AN6C34MX92LG2_20354,Poor story line. Poor selection of songs. Lanza's sing and acting is great as always. lanza's voice is the only redeeming reason to watch this film.
A3GZ5AKUJBYPBG_15017,I have rated this movie based on having seen it previously.  I was unable to watch the movie when I recently accessed it on my Prime account because there was no video signal communicated to my TV from my iPad.
A38OROMVMATYOG_305,One of my favorite movies of my youth. It was one that the whole family enjoyed. A good movie to take me back.
A1041053SID37WN8GTT8_2377,"This movie is brilliant, it's captivating and unique and as terrific acting and directing. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes science and genetics."
AJ8G9QCQSLZTB_10360,"Classic I loved as a kid.  Never realized how long it was.  Great movie to keep the kids occupied for 2hrs, except for all the singing CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG CHITTY CHITTY BANG....  :)"
A2NIF3BKZKK3H8_14982,I was really prepared to love this but it was a lot more vulgar than other versions. The acting was good over all but not my favorite rendition of the classic novel.
A1KBYG8FZLG2AJ_9830,I am a John Wayne fan and teamed with Kirk Douglas the duo is unbeatable!  Classic war tale with a fine cast and solid acting.
A1HCGGVH16HNES_21151,costner was a little too full of himself. tombstone was more entertaining. but it was  probably a more accurate portrayal of Earp
A5O6OR1F40RBZ_23779,"Somewhat entertaining In that the movie would probably appeal to most people's revenge side however, very predictable."
A1LY9I9HS4MZJH_4288,"excellent movie and lot's of action, maybe a bit of the horror of war.  still good!"
A2XYDLEO2QPXIF_12969,"Overall, I enjoyed the movie. There were holes in the story, but still enjoyed it."
AWT1SIE9XIEJF_8703,This is a classic that is well worth watching by anyone. Those with an interest in science will be especially entertained. Very good performances coupled with some great scenery and spectacular machinery.
A6Q8VGVWEHX4S_7821,Amy Grant is amazing. She should have won an Oscar. Susan Sarandon is a perfect witch.
AO05IVMCX03H9_10295,"A great movie to watch, Peter Fonda and Brooke Shields made a good pair for the story plot. I really like this movie and very glad that I was able to buy it and in dvd form."
A2AV7Q95QGPTO0_23468,"Robert DeNiro may be a great actor, but not in this Turkey. We bought ""Benny and June"" with Johnny Depp at the same time as this. Buy it instead."
A2AXQ0P5ON6NPZ_21945,So this is a family that has their minds stuck in the 60's when they are the 90's right now.  How lame its not worth it
A2LFEIB07H21S7_6693,great old movie good for entire family . Good plot great monster. They just don't make movies like this no more . Must see to enjoy. Safe for entire family to watch.
A24PIFEQVB18HO_8544,"Classic Nicholson movie. A definite for any true movie lovers collection.
Awesome early performances by Christopher Lloyd and Danny DeVito, both of Taxi fame."
A2VE1RLWG9DGEZ_10366,Did not play properly .skipped several scenes .probably just the disk. anyway not a good experience. Thank you very much for your time
A3B9XTIDLP6BKN_17130,After having worn out the idea the next obvious next step is to go to a completely different time to abuse the talent there.
A31FR57M9KMTEX_18521,"godzilla vs gigan on dvd is not totally clean , gets subtitles in english and frech,languages in english and japanese."
A2G71M4HFFPJJN_19125,Weird and twisted; most of the characters minus one seem to have major character flaws. Shocking ending. Not for the faint of heart.
A3K4SYLXDN7BNB_21540,"The product quality was excellent, but this is a movie you should rent instead of buying.  or at least rent before you buy."
A35IBKGL6A9PHS_13737,"I was expecting the deleted scenes to be in the movie, not separate from the movie. The deleted scenes were just ""extras"" and had a lot of talk between each scene. Other than that, the movie itself was good."
A2T2W4ULXB8LYN_2686,This was a Christmas gift and my dad was thrilled with it and included it in his New Years weekend plans of course.
A3F7PBATA5KROT_20295,This movie was kind of hard to get into. The subject matter was a little strange and it took me awhile to truly understand what was going on.
A224SP5OR1C2TO_1302,"This is just not an 'ordinary' movie.  For that alone it has some merit, but if you have a desire to see different perspectives on things, this is worth a watch.  It is excellently made."
AF4RCK5SC5IKK_19481,"It is a great movie, the only problem I found is that it is not subtitled to spanish. My family is mostly latino :( They should had put it on the cover :("
A20LF4TQ5M0RHJ_18970,"Generally, I love movies of this type. However, there was no ending. A literal cliffhanger that will never be resolved. Watch Oceans 11 instead."
AMPHEG5NOGT8X_8067,"Though not a Disney Classic, it is as good as.  Children and adults can enjoy the humor and story.  One of the most entertaining Disney movies out there."
A3KZTEUNNB20OY_18667,"Griffith basically plays an earlier version of Gomer Pyle.  Worth watching one time, but no real desire to see it again."
A21LHH643WXHSC_3928,"no foul language, no graphic sexual situations is why I chose it. However it's however it's old and tired thus the 3 stars."
A30NVSLEMRKEW1_13230,"A delightful Preston Sturges classic is destroyed on DVD by Universal with a cheap, VHS-quality transfer. Shame on them!"
A2DXI8AYJTW7K_7707,This movie is another milestone for both Danny Glover and Oprah. A movie that definitely leaves an imprint on your heart when you watch it!
AIQKV4MZ9CIUM_22125,"A good story and excellent cast. It appears a little slow at times, but stay with it
And you will be rewarded!"
A25CZT19NKX96H_2226,This is good. I am not a huge fan of Elmo but my kid likes him.
A3U0ER6TKM83C8_19498,"This is one of his lesser know movies, I never seen or heard about it before I saw the video.  The plot was a bit thin but I was able to sit through the entire movie without falling asleep."
A2YWDZU5O3SZU6_2245,It's a Kid's movie and my son like it. It made my son stop a monkey role and stay to watch.
A18H50IXCFI2O4_6089,"If you like high school stoner movies, this movie is great. Very funny and a great price. Worth buying for the price."
AGQNHTWFLBTIS_2625,"A great movie! Very good story, excellent acting. Beautifully written story line that is fun to follow."
A1SKNFXR9R02S5_16640,"Found out with this film that blu-ray isn't worth it for older movies.  This is the 4:3 aspect ratio and is grainy on a large screen.  Still a great movie, but just not worth expense of blu-ray format."
A15B0S6G66B7Z1_1863,This 2000 edition of the DVD is awesome! Contains widescreen & full screen version. Digital image of the film is great!
A14ENRUZIHBOP9_5158,Great movie you want to watch over and over. Great performance. Seller was fair with price and great with delivery. AAA+++++++++++++
A3S06D3SIF0G54_17403,Complete waste of time - fast forward if you must watch this - it is horrible
AROPYUEN349VH_16477,"Interestingly done.  None of the silly photography ""tricks"" film makers seem to love these days.  Made it much more watchable than something newer.  From what I can gather, historically accurate."
A31718KLBY28J8_15623,Another movie to add to my Robert Downey Jr. collection. Not too bad of a movie. It is nice to see where these actors have gotten to since this movie came out.
A1EFV36G1ROXUS_19142,"bought this to watch and when i clicked on the play , it displayed that this video will not play, so i watched it on u-tube instead. I t should be removed so this won't happen to anyone else."
A5I88702K12HM_1643,"This movie was watchable, surprisingly gory, and kept me entertained throughout. However, it is definitely not anything you haven't seen before and isn't too spectacular.

And the second movie, coming soon, looks like it could be 100x better..."
A1C0NMCONVFVF4_1873,"Entertaining story of photographer Faye Dunaway as the title character, a photographer of models getting bumped off, who has visions of their murders as they happen.  Shocking climactic ending! Chilling!"
A1C3VSB50ELP6V_10276,"This movie is basically a soap opera trying to pass for a horror flick. Plots are very bland, nothing unique about it, and the monster are a borrowed alien movie costume. Very dull to watch."
AADZIDXTF2NUJ_1997,"Awesome movie and it looks great in blu-ray. The seller was super quick and it was packaged great. I've seen the movie several times but watching it on blu-ray was best
thanks again"
A3B7Z162COPDWN_17766,"Pretty poor acting, but great photo shoot for Bo Derek.  She was beautiful in this and the photography was great."
A1VA46Q78W15YD_18978,It was very good but not quite as good as the remake from 2003. Michael Caine makes it worth the time to watch.
A2LZZQOSSFN3DC_1916,"Singing is great, everyone should see this version just to see Carol Burnett as Miss Hannigan."
A2UEZKCPP6B2U7_7133,"Kevin did it again!!!  He's great at playing a crazy person n sweet at the same time.
PS: Don't ever let yourself get hypnotized !
Well. played by all.
Another great edge of your seat flick....."
A2ECYCMXNSYOPX_9722,"arrived well packaged, it is a gift, so i have not opened the actual disc set. am more interested in the 3D effects, i know the boat sank !"
A1BFMWEWDIHU1L_6222,"We really enjoyed this movie. Saw it about 15-20 years ago, but caught it again on Prime the other day. Funny and touching. Julia and Hugh at their prime."
A3V522YGU0U5YQ_5072,"Bought as a gift for my husband, who loves musicals.  He absolutely loved it!  He was excited to see it on Blu-Ray."
A2Y29IRSI08F0I_15947,I really like this movie and have watched it several times. I would buy it again and it does have several classic moments.
A3SZ152E6BBTOK_23540,Fun old movie starring a young pre-Astaire Ginger Rogers. Silly plot but entertaining. Basil Rathbone is the best part of the whole thing.
AQ4K84QQBB7WG_21688,Call me bias but Lee rocks as Dracula in the vintage Hammer Horror films. This movie had some fun moments but Lee as Fu Manchu just seemed awkward to me. Good for a laugh but not much else.
AMV4KOYNSP2UB_18211,"very enjoyable family film version of this classic story, i remember watching this on TV in my younger days and it has lost none of its' appeal with the passing of years"
A1BUDQ79007HRX_22825,Watch it every year and you never get tired of it. This version is not as good as the black and white than out a long time ago.
A2OFC0HCXCM2PU_13861,I loved this movie when it first came out... but now... it just didn't age well. Bad script and lots of over acting... Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy together is the only reason to watch this... they are pros...
A3818DTTMGT8MO_9347,This is an excellent classic movie.  Danny Kaye at his best.  A must see movie.
A9Q28YTLYREO7_14909,"I really dug this Film. The Sex,Humor went hand&hand. A lot of Cool Action. The film gets to the point without a long drawn out story line. It's Worth Checking out especially on a Saturday Night."
A2ONLDB3HCV1K2_8690,"what this movie is saying that you can believe in god or not and you'll still get what you want, so what's the point in believing in god?"
AKAY9O86FHWXF_12793,Decent movie but all the Star Treks are kind of cheesy. Not a big Star Trek fan one of the worse sci-fi ever made.
A204IS3LM0G5WR_70,"I thought the movie was great when it came out in 1979 and still think it's great today. This is a good movie for the whole family to watch; however, not sure if the kids of today would appreciate it."
A20LK1LAVKME10_12418,This is one of my favorite movies from my teenage years.  Enjoyed watching it again
A3AJSON8SXXBX5_5394,for richer or poorer staring Tim Allen is a very funny movie a 5 star Tim Allen and Kristy Alley team up for the first time when they move in to live with the Amish its very funny to watch.
A38104N0JXPBSL_1921,"happy wife happy life
i think silly to need so many words for a review):
five more words. lol Zzz"
A31CFKM5SPS4IR_13141,"Great movie, even better in HD, one of Eddie Murphys best, If you area fan this is going to be a non stop laugh, you cant go wrong, especially with the great supporting cast."
A21XTXC51GHL8J_7004,I've seen plenty of haunting type movies and this one beats them all. Chills up the back of your neck through the whole film...
A1NK6ISR6IS4PL_15773,This was a favorite of my own children. We watched it together and had the best time remembering better days. I couldn't believe how much the main actors hadn't change!
AAEEXHRP4QBQ1_15913,"Finally getting its day of respect - this tough, scary nightmarish noir stands with the best. Bridges is unhinged and menacing, a surprise for anyone who only remembers Sea Hunt and Airplane!"
AHL98CA2CJHQF_13317,Not as good as most of the Friday the 13th episodes because it's full of kids.  Some of the other episodes have more adults in them.
ASYN7RG93QPAY_5449,"So worth every single penny. What an underrated masterpiece. Well, it could have done without the strange celebrity casting, but Kilmer does a fine job. Just as good as the C. Heston version."
A1DPDIRQVH342D_7745,"I added this to my Julia Roberts  movie collection.....GREAT movie and anyone who is a fan of hers, will want for their collection ALSO"
A27XCMCRB2Y40Q_3056,"A great comedy and cast wonderfully. Bill Reynolds is priceless in this movie, I've never seen him be so funny."
A3INOE9VZMPM3L_483,Life for servants and upper class in turn of the century England. Contains quite a bit of history and different sides of political issues. My favorite soap opera and show of all time.
AM2ZRXBPRH1D5_17713,Ok. Acting is good but perhaps I already knew the plot so it wasn't that interesting.
A3JIJAF43PE6EA_21369,One of Glenn Ford's last and he's good. The rest of the cast is weak and the plot is thin.
A21O521CTFTPY2_1657,"THIS DVD WAS EXACTLY WHAT I HAVE FOREVER WANTED.I LOVE THE MOVIE SO MUCH.I THINK THE ACTORS CHOOSEN FOR THIS MOVIE ARE GREAT.THE MOVIE CAME IN FAST,NEW AND PACKED GREAT."
AFVHO52P7IMPG_3208,I am a huge fan of Daniel Day- Lewis and his pairing with Juliette Binoche in this movie was absolutely amazing. The supporting cast was equally amazing
A32YP7TLINXUNZ_18033,Interesting movie but not one of the best. Strauss keeps it interesting but the plot is a little ridiculous.
A3U8J6HOIYKIFM_14520,I have no memory of purchasing this product. Perhaps it was bought as a gift. I can't write a review as I do not have it.
A14NF5B1Y55DLE_2470,Take away the science fiction trappings and this is the tired old story of the younger brother who can never measure up to his older brother.  Who cares?
A3F5JAUKAL4RRU_8185,A CLASSIC!!! I wore this out on VHS when I was a little girl. I am so excited to get this for my kids for Christmas so they can share in the magic that I had when I was little!
A32PF10DWLXEWK_15159,"Great quality on a film that was borderline horrible, which is a shame  since Henry Fonda is one of my favorite actors of all time"
ACSMP209L1GT3_9127,I really enjoyed this gentle comedy about a station on the way to heaven.  It's an afterlife love story that will warm your heart and make you laugh.
A1KQ379THYTYGV_6012,"Beautifully acted and faithful to the language and spirit of the book.  However, it's difficult to care about these characters."
A38HCXBEX2W9CN_13824,Good action packed/beautiful scenery movie. A bit on the pricey side for a movie but was entertaining to watch and what's not to like about the legend John Wayne?
ALC7YWS2TEDK8_4593,You can never go wrong with w classic about two Cowboys learning the ropes of the city while trying to save someone
A3TVTGIS300OTU_14700,"This is labeled as region-B, but its not. Its actually region-free. This is the German BD release."
A1GWCQ5OZ19J4Z_17573,"Little better than ""B"" grade acting except for Helen Morin.  Barely plausible scenario but was good to see Kier Dulae again."
A3UTRAYQ22J1C8_6232,"It's a feel-good movie with good sense of humor. Julia Roberts is very likable in this film. The whole plot is unrealistic, could never, well almost never happen, but it is enjoyable."
A1HIXSSDV3RMSU_6278,Saw it with my daughter who had never seen it - I had seen it many times in the past - not as good now as it was years ago
A305JZPTYTZX92_8147,I bought this movie for a gift and it was in excellent conditions.  Really like the product and the movie.
A23YL13B67INJI_3580,"This Blu-ray B&W DVD look. Looks like it was just filmed. Almost a 3D quality about it! Classic movie. Watch this every Christmas as well as ""A Christmas Story"". (going to shoot your eye out kid)"
AKUDXZUFDO9ML_11118,I liked the first part of film and the third part. The 2nd part was kind of boring.
A1NSXDS5MLI48X_13193,well this cartoon has similarities to peanuts an frost an santa clauses its probably the first to show different ethnics Chinese guy an afro American girl etc. ...its a fine holiday toon ...
AENU742EV17J7_1986,Great movie musical. A good reminder of the old days of Little Orphan Annie and Daddy Warlocks. Never get tired of watching it.
A7TIWX1I4Y37U_3224,This is one of my all time favorite movies. One question. A previous reviewer said don't buy the DVD because it was missing scenes. Was he referring to the Criterion Collection version?
AN8B0GA55DG0Y_21174,Worth watching for the content and the presentation on one stage with only two sets.  Julie Harris is captivating as Emily.  Especially recommended for college students.
A22F3RE1VHXMGN_21412,I hated it! Did not know what it was about. I'll have to screen the things I buy more carefully.
A3FF0XBIN2IC4O_22064,Bit dated now. Don't think the sailors of the day were as depicted. Good job by Anthony Hopkins and Mel Gibson
A2BWMLUK6RIK92_1775,A classic musical play captured in film and is very well done. 5 stars for sure!
A3IOAA22WPJ2MT_15303,"That crazy Canadian Cronenberg. A descent job of mixing mad scientist, sexy monster, and the infected."
A1EUV4BEQOOGAQ_13470,"Good  old movie, thanks. I remember this old movie from the 50's. Good old B movie. Would be good in movie collection."
A1DUU4BBVTZECU_13879,"This here is a classic werewolf movie. Its as scary as I remember. If you like good old werewolf movies, this is it."
A6SJYNBZ87E0N_11609,Saw this movie years ago. By todays standards it would suck tremendously. There as been a lot of improvements and technology it would be better . I would like to see a remake of this movie now.
A10J9HOYTZNS4A_14124,Previous 70's release was far better.  How does one make a great plot tedious?  Here's the answer.
A20R9QMZPQHMZR_21593,Terrible story line. Terrible development of relationship of characters. Terrible reason for any of the action sequences. Disliked it intensely.
A1DSOF0EK9G06C_3176,"Cary Grant and Joan Fontaine are a fine couple, but the magic is not there in this film which was released in 2004. I guess I should have gotten the blu-ray if there is one."
AH6ASY8ZMQ2SZ_3090,I love Demi Moore.  This is a very good movie although not her best.  I like it even better on Blu-ray!
AIFO41VARFJBA_6239,"A potentially good show, however it is very slow moving.  Also, the roommate is crude and disgusting most of the time.  Him I could have done without."
A3Q867M7U1ODME_13338,I think this is one of the best Star Trek movies. It keeps your attention and is entertaining and ties in well with the episode from the original series.
A3ERP0MPW0GO3R_15498,"Extremely stylish, even if somewhat dated. Much more preferable to the remake ( which seems somewhat cliched)."
A2ZW2ZE26SN1YP_7962,This is a good fairy tale movie.  Girls of all ages will love this romantic fairy tale movie.  You will love this movie.
A9HXFEYMC6J0Q_15488,"Tom Cruise and Paul Newman make the most of this story, which isn't much, abut a mentor grooming a young talent at pool."
A2ECRRNKVVLY99_18881,"Okay movie, would have been better if the fake BLOOD was actually Red instead of Orange. Kind of made me sick to watch!"
A3F5KKZA5121CS_18711,I wonder if any of this story did really happen. I was told that it is authentic. It is scary if it is.
A2YGEB7P4MNER6_23702,"I bought this movie only because Jane Seymour is in it, not because I like James Bond movies. It's one of Jane's earlier efforts and does not give justice to her superior acting abilities."
A3SWKWIGOWAAD_4335,"Very realistic, historical, characters where well cast. I enjoy military based movies based on real events."
A2SIQT1V4CZ0Z8_17669,"Video DVD failed after watching just three times. DVD purchased less than six months ago
and cannot be exchanged for replacement. Movie is excellent but defective DVD disc in such
a short time is unacceptable."
A24RBX8I526QMZ_7020,Rollercoaster although a dated film delivers a non stop rollercoaster all it's own. How will the suspect be stopped or will he ever be caught you need to see the film to find out.....
A3EUYVUXN464AJ_15906,This is the worst piece of garbage ever committed to film.  No wonder they broke up.
A4DXI79ISF2T1_21921,"Watched it again after many years, came across a bit thin. However, if you haven't seen it and you're a movie fan, it's worth watching."
A2GFEJ7PQBUF7X_9125,"Layered, textured performances by a great cast, can be haunting and presents some moral questions which still are studied even today in movies like Cloud Atlas."
A2P94LQO48Z8X3_7798,"This is not playable on any US players.  It is locked by Region Code B which is for Europe and Africa.  If you are living in the United States, do not buy this or anything from Imports."
A23LTYI6FN8Y7E_16847,A true interesting movie that speaks to different issues that still exist today. It shows that some movies can still be relevant despite not having the glitz of production and animation.
A22RY8N8CNDF3A_2321,"This is good for about the first five minutes, and after that it becomes increasingly boring. The gags are too simplistic and obvious. And I like Monty Python!"
A16OZBU3XRZ4DQ_10827,"It's exactly how I remembered it when
I saw it at a drive in theater in the 80s."
A3C56IXBT4ETXA_1029,the acting was great for comedy and subject matter.  Fun movie to watch with friends on a Saturday afternoon-Comedy horror
A17DM35UV124B1_2208,"Excellent movie, hard to find and worth the investment. Excellent addition to the collection. I am still looking for other Charles Bronson necessary collection movies.  But I am a patient person. :)"
A2B4RPOY0H2X3U_7501,"Happy to find the Special Edition.
Two fun characters to watch fall in love.
Love Richard and Julia"
AZFG86CTD0O52_1929,"my mother loved it, very good story .
I'm so lucky to be on Amazon, they are always
so helpful and to navigate the site is very simple
one very happy customer."
A3BOQUOU79BQ8B_20679,The movie didn't keep my attention past the first few minutes. I didn't finish the movie it seemed boring and uninteresting!
AKU4IJEPWCX6T_23194,I was not really impressed with the plot acting. I came to expect much more from so many great actors. This movie for me came up far short.
APKVQ4NJS59FR_2326,I LOVED this flick in my high school days. I bought it when it was a good price to reminisce and turns out it's not as funny these days.
A1GTD9YMT653GD_235,We love Arthur! It's great that this film explores other seasonal holidays as well. A great learning experience that is entertaining for both kids and their parents.
A2W9J1ZCL5N1ZB_7216,EVERYBODY THINKS THIS IS BETTER THAN SIXTH SENSE.NO IT ISNT! THIS MOVIE WAS A LITTLE SCARY BUT IT COPIED RIGHT OFF OF SIXTH SENSE.SEE THAT INSTEAD
A1ECRFTQIQEZUU_19282,The other reviews have accurately conveyed everything wrong with this cinematic migraine so I'll point out the positive... Kandyse McClure in that yellow mini dress the ONLY reason I watched. The only good thing about this movie.
AXHR94EVPADQG_7540,A little underwhelming what with the gaping potholes and lack of sci fi aesthetic from the first but still heartwarming.
A2GYIZ74N28BI1_18150,I honestly couldn't watch the whole thing or even 1/3 of this. I can't say anything concrete about it except I thought the characters were stereotypes and the movie was slow. I think it's probably just not my genre.
ABTVQ2R4U7HG7_19277,Extremely boring.  I couldn't get more than twenty minutes into it; even that was too much.
A2Y9E66RNP0U22_689,"Watch again and again, cult classic, being diabetic, so much we have learned since then, just the love and one liners"
A13LHVIP1419G4_11078,"It would be five, but one of my favorite scenes is deleted from this version.  Great movie!"
AEZ8WH06SEW6K_2098,Such an excellent movie.  I am going to watch it over and over again. It's a great watch with the hubby.
A2L167UOLOYOO0_7362,Great film for a family to watch. There is some foul language in the film but the message about importance of love comes through well. Classic that looks great on blu-ray.
A1VBRKZ0SF2DSC_8123,"We love Cinderella. It is a timeless classic. My young children 2&4 love the mice, especially Gus-Gus!! I like it because they are not frightened by any evil in it."
A1O1CSEH84UVHW_3965,"I thought it was a DVD instead it was a VHS which I can't use,  it was totally my fault, I didn't notice it in the description.  Love the movie so I ordered another copy in DVD."
A3K4FMTL9I2C3L_14794,Good movie.. Was the one I thought I was ordering when I got Shelly Winters photo instead.
A3FMXN13I8KVDZ_16959,"I can only speak to the first 40 minutes, because that's as long as we could bear to watch it. Slow, dull, with bad acting. Perhaps it gets better in the second half, but I will never know."
A314EDZFGCCI6F_14355,Good portrayal of factual events leading up to attack on Pearl Harbor Dec 7 1941
ALAPPZ0D8C3L2_12236,"Very good. A simple, pleasantly told story wonderfully voiced by Tom Smothers & friends. An always five."
ATJF5QEVNMWIL_23975,This movie is great 80s cheese. The movie has great atmosphere and the music fits perfectly. BUT WHY is there NO WIDESCREEN?? This movie has been edited to fit your tv.
A256T5PCQ0UZIM_22009,"Very watchable. Bare boobs in a couple of spots seemed out of place and didn't add anything, except boobs. The May December romance angle with the Newman character seemed highly improbable."
A1L1B4UK75BCFL_13074,When I realized what I ordered I turned it off...Don't be fooled by PG rating...NOT FOR KIDS
A1TN8A6PENVN8D_10214,Classical Sellers and Pink Panther.  Some scenes are outdated but today's standards but overall it is clean fun!
A2I9QSI0CO5AIY_23361,"I am half-way through and will watch it only out of curiosity.
The Red Dragon was, by far, way better."
A1TV688C0IMOO6_6591,"This movie captivated me. It was kind of messed up and sickening, yet at the same time had a great story and surprisingly a good moral."
A1B61ZED7288CC_22605,My husband wanted us to own a copy of this movie.  I was unimpressed.. Thank goodness for other distractions.
A16YOB8YFHID3Y_17671,"Greta Garbo has always been interesting to watch, with her many expressions, especially sad ones, and her great looks.  However the story itself is thin, more a vehicle to look at Garbo than a really interesting story."
A2XOKPA8FRSMRB_6940,I got this movie for a friend for Christmas and she loved the movie. Me on the other hand hated it. I really didn't understand the end of it.
AZXR8OWGQRQ9X_13865,"Love John Wayne, but just could not get into this movie. Guess I just prefer Cowboys and war movies with him better"
AC2AK61N0EKPE_19876,"I didn't like this movie, very disappointed and I love Bogart movies.
That's my comment on this movie. Thanks

."
A3IDC2HKELAYWT_17290,"Good actors with bad direction and iffy script, I think: nowhere as sinister as Dangerous Liaisons which is much more entertaining."
A3KXAY9CMIZUEZ_8685,"An acceptable science fiction film - which changes the book.  The novel has a more international perspective, and is less accepting of faith as a form of knowledge."
A1W370PSJY5CA7_5410,I got his movie because i like the  female star that was in it for only about 2 minutes it was the stupidest movie i ever saw i through it away in the garbage
AON6ZIVWEVEJM_18015,"Didn't really care for this movie.  I thought with the actors it would have been better.  Someone else might like it, but I didn't.  Sorry"
A1B5L9AG1GB2MT_15574,"Forbin is a character more akin to ""The Rat Patrol's Captain Dietrich of Hans Gudegast than Eric Braeden's Victor Newman from ""The Young and the Restless.""  The pace is a little slow and things do not end well."
AOZ3M0U00V99P_21618,"I starting watching this with my husband and couldn't get into it. I'm a fan of sci-fi, but found this series boring."
A23LEVR072VF6K_4207,I did not see it as a realistic war movie but it was very entertaining.
A3YW07H3DKVEH_4120,"Every element of this movie exceeded my expectations, but the superb acting really takes this movie to the top.  To say it's worth the viewing time would be an understatement."
A18JXYJ9WVXO2D_17455,This video was pretty awful.  Seemed like one of those movies that was done with a home camera.  I would give it zero stars if I could.
ACO7Y2WX471SP_2267,"I can only say that my 14 month old nephew was enthralled by this film...and I found it entertaining as well. Very nicely done! Mandy Patinkin steals the show, and Vanessa Williams little musical number stopped it! Bravo!"
A3K0AM9FYF0UPI_15924,"I saw this movie on its original release and enjoyed it.  Now, many years later, it seems obvious and heavy handed.  Time has not been kind."
AQDNQLKMG7HBX_2806,This is a movie I refer to quite often when strange things happen in the media. Had to have it in my collection to share with others who may rely too much on the news.
AEAJTB1USRIE5_2580,"Classic story of man's temptation, a woman's cleverness and a woman's seemingly naive and innocent power.  Brilliant acting by all, great story and enjoy watching more than once."
A5A5BOL02Q1NT_18591,This is one a kind movies that i liked as a kid AND NOW I GO AND GET THIS ONE AND THE RECORDING SUCKS!!!!!PLEASE GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK FOR THESE 2ND RATED DVD YOU CALL CLASSIC'S
A8I54OGV2WNJT_7892,While a kids movie basically it is one of my favorites with Amy Adams.  The mix of real people with cartons is enchanting.  Wonderful song and very Disney.  Loved it.
A39C5OIZ3I3PK5_1898,This movie is one of the unknown greats in my opinion....I love everything about this movie and am going my kids are old enough to enjoy it with me now!!!
A3N44846RKHO40_7846,"I love this Movie, it's really good along with the Music.  Bedside's, it has a GIRL in it, HUBBA HUBBA, O LA LA, O LA LA, O LA, O LA, O LA LA, HUBBA HUBBA O LA LA."
A2QGTBATWMGSOP_10076,Too little action - story was too dragged out.  I like Matt Damon but this was a bummer part for him.
AJVFQ6O7268KQ_11894,"Loved the book wished that the dvd had WORKED.  Second disc kept skipping all over the place.

Was not the equipment...we tried it on others then discarded.  Returning way too much hassle.

Just won't buy dvd over the web...Yael"
A1U9GHQBFJV3LQ_3665,Watch it every year. It never gets to old to remember the good old days.
A17N79D5PI5BMN_638,Any die-hard Spice Girl fan must have this item! The video box differs from the main one that was sold at the time of release. *Special Edition*!!!
A13I3HBCZ3DJ4B_16010,"Who doesn't like a movie about an underdog. The movie had some good parts but tends to lag here and there, but all told it was good."
A1VZ0SF3WGAHIY_10621,Very poor movie. The lead actor is not funny. The title sequence is very good but there is no reason to watch after the credits.
ANU264A6H0ZR8_19626,"3 1/2 stars out of 5

The Blu-ray is a nice upgrade over the dvd. The Tom Weaver commentary is excellent and made the revisit very enjoyable.

The film is a solid '50s American monster movie."
A3KGJE4LQW0T2Q_18,Since I love Henry Winkler this is an easy one to enjoy. Henry is such a great actor.
A20R415YFOMUPH_17378,"Don't like ""R"" rated movies, think they can be done without the smut and I intend to throw it away, not the fault of the sellers, just didn't see the rating."
AI9Z4BM4OQDFM_17674,"Bronson is great, story is good, I am old and so is this movie.  Not a classic, just a pastime"
A3V1JGT8CDTUR2_5293,Just a great humorous western with two great actors !  Hepburn & Wayne - what a combo !
A3NZ3SXT2JHWMH_12252,"I HAD great expectations about this dvd.. cause I dearly love the Bee Gees, but to me, I didn't get pass 30 minutes, and just ejected it..."
A2BS7HCDRHH8X6_23860,Quintine is from another planet. i couldn't connect at all. I bailed after 10 min.
A3K0EPJSA0GZQF_6517,"Confusing, slow and not believable. I grew tired before the end and couldn't go through with the rest of it."
A6LXKCKCBLZCR_19954,"whole movie could have been condenser into 10 minutes, and still would not have been worth the time. fast forward"
A313FM1PCAAYUH_23826,"This is the English dub (a really poorly made dub), no original audio. Jackie Chan's name is Freddy. This is an insult to great cinema. Don't bother."
A372UFZ8CKTA6P_20937,I heard a lot about the movie so maybe I expected too much. Was good.
A35TCNACWMZDHI_9779,"The Box of it is so detail you can fell its like its an actual small ship, the art book is awesome and there's a lot of stuff you will enjoy!
I recommend this for Titanic lovers"
ASUPNNQCRBJA7_20489,"Ok performance for Sean Penn and Christopher Walken. Engaging plot, but story line could have been better developed."
A1CIRBC4BUMMSC_3486,"Sad how drugs destroy people's lives. It's a good movie. Johnny Depp did an excellent job as George Jung. The movie is full of money, greed, danger, and, of course, drugs."
A3QQLY48RJUAXH_16635,"What can you say? Katherine Hepburn, Humphrey Bogart -- directed by John Huston!
Just so well done.  Makes me long for a ""kinder, gentler"" time of film making."
AUULTTD0XTMM8_5854,"From France, there is only two or three films a year that are memorable. This is one of them."
A16WGUVUHOSCAL_16403,"I bought this movie for my husband,( who usually likes the action movies), he couldn't believe I found it and at such a good price."
AT1PIN6WA88V9_8630,This movie was long and boring.  I gave it one star because I like Paul Newman.  Whoever came up with this story had nothing better to do.  What a waste of time!
A1ZKKJ05EJYJOH_23582,"WB ruined the dvd of ""It takes two"" by releasing it in full screen only. it was filmed in widescreen. re-release it in letterbox."
A1X054KUYG5V_23661,"The Bottom Line:

One of Woody Allen's more minor works, Mighty Aphrodite is pleasant enough and features a winning performance by Mira Sorvino, but doesn't have the staying power or distinctiveness of his better films."
A2S689D469XHA1_106,This is one of my favorite versions of the Scrooge story but they never show it now I can watch when I want to
A1D3APXAR9QZOO_14867,John Candy need a vacation away from the FAA Control Tower Airport and take a different approach to race the Sailboat championship.
A347PU47OQ5Z92_5182,"Steve Martin at his best. Not going for the Oscar, just trying to give you a few laughs."
A1WHYKEDG27613_14246,"This movie never got much acclaim, but it is an action packed thriller, that will make you emote for the whale (at least to  a point)."
A32JZ9XNHMNWOO_9617,...as the young lady goes exploring under the restaurant table is worth the price of the disc alone...
A3W2JMKMGUOI42_3655,It was  no more than okay. Great actors but maybe they needed the money or something. This movie talks you to death
A1SF25EXWAZZ08_11146,"Feel guilty praising such a scary, eerie film but so very effective that it is an absolute classic.
Gets to our primal fears"
A2JXO5W5J8OEGO_21003,It was an average monster flick. This one featured an American who worked for the military.
A15JZI09NAEQAH_8743,It was hard to keep up at first and the sound is pretty low but it was great. It is a pretty slow and long movie with a lot packed into a couple of hours. Highly recommend.
AJ6SFQPGWIHG0_17595,"A movie about an artificial intelligence that takes hostages...HAL has nothing on Proteus. Cutting edge special effects for its time, a sci-fi movie that is more relevant now than ever."
A3DWNL6E0CXVLA_22338,"With all the stars in this film, I though this must be a terrific movie but NO.... not at all.  I was terrible.  It tried to be funny but missed the mark."
AQNP6RI4QY5UI_3753,"Hard to come up with words for this one.  Everything that could have been said, has already.  This movie will go down through the ages and continue to hold is mystical hold on anyone who watches it."
AJJGZBCHGHYEN_23616,"I recently saw this video, I still liked it almost as much as the first time."
A1K0DIPHY379Q2_22291,"The later episodes are good, but some are preachy and the early ones really suffer from a low budget."
A2QBNW0FTHH31Y_376,Good show featuring the very funny Bob Newhart. This completes my collection and will be enjoyed as part of a marathon.
A2ZM17X1WDLLXB_18128,Couldn't make it through more than 15 minutes---I guess it just didn't hold up for me.
AZKUIW4BNEFWR_8238,"I buy a second time this cartoon. The first for his wife, she loves this cartoon, the second for her nephew, he is delighted with him."
A4GSQJBIIWK5I_17338,there were rumors that animals were abused while filming. and i actually believe them. it all looks to real when the cat or pug are attacked by something
A3N0KD2VX4H239_15337,"I've seen this movie twice. It is a little disturbing, but not very well done, very over acted."
ATK88JVN6KSLZ_19526,Despite a possible good story...I could not get past the very bad acting.  This story deserved a lot better.
A1AQFDGHZL4Y4H_12504,"a classic 80's flick with all the right stuff. teenage craziness, parties, sex, drama, love, fights, and a mixed bag of a plot! what more could you ask for from an 80's classic!"
A2MG58QRZ29EUR_12608,If you have never watched this film about 15 into  you will realize that most sitcoms and dramas have borrowed this exact story line.  Not to mention the film Suburbia.
A2WZ85I7QSBVHU_2081,"I have a hearing loss so, like in many British TV productions, I have some difficulty with dealing with the British accents.  However, Rumpole is such a great character, I love watching the programs."
AK8QECQY7CHB8_19543,Two great talents were wasted in this paultry effort. Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn were both miscast. Story line was absurd.
A22KMCKYE5KQ2X_13833,I love this oldie! Just a cool film to watch for Halloween season. Felt original.
A2DWVSQNNOW5HA_22298,"I am probably going to be the only person who did not care for this! Maybe, if I watched it again I would have better review!"
A1VFLHH91N4DNR_5242,"One of Patrick Swayze's BEST! Right behind Road House, Dirty Dancing, and Ghost. GREAT work by Patrick. The character he plays is so genuine and believable. GREAT film!"
A33S60JVN2CNTM_20560,Story was o k but the  language was filthy. I threw it away. I hope young people skip the movie.
A7014XG14M30F_5008,One of the best movies of its time and EXCELLENT cast with spectacular performances by Robert Duvall & Gregory Peck !
AUN3NJUBVU6FK_3592,"Excellent family fare. Unfortunately, they don't make them like this, anymore. Too much emphasis on glitz and special effects, in today's family-style videos."
A1SEESSHPOTSDY_1543,I am really disappointed by the poor transfer of this BR release. There is no need to buy the BR version if you have the DVD.
AAMZ5CERAN0B5_2978,I am a fan of Bill Pullman so I like all his movies  I also liked the TV show The Virginian
AC4OBKNZF0AQQ_16171,Just plain not bad. What's ironic is that I've been places on this Earth that remind me of these people on the Island. Yes it's worth your time and money. Count Wolfenstein
A2WM0PZF0B9G20_16696,"I first saw this movie as a teenager, it was great to go down memory lane"
AL47TOHUO3U6I_4532,"I really enjoy this movie, and this DVD was great. I had no issues with it at all, and this movie definitely made an all girls day that I recently had more enjoyable!"
A1ZCYC0RHTRMZF_7186,"Although it doesn't seem as original as The Sixth Sense, Kevin Bacon carries it off.  A fun scary popcorn thinking flick."
A3R4OBLGEUYQQM_11861,"Some of our best friends showed us this while visiting and we were in stitches. So, I had to buy one so I could share it with others. This is great, clean, Christian comedy. Anyone would enjoy this guy's humor."
ADJ4M8X3UWSZF_13087,This was a great movie in the 80's before movies really went into going way out with digital effects.  Does contain nudity and sex as this is the original movie shown in theaters.
A3OBX1STQOIQM9_19121,"This is the ""horror"" films I grew up on.  If you're into fake looking monsters, this will get a movie for you!"
A1C9R2WPEO2J4P_14038,"Would have been ok, but the summation at the end was terrible. Poirot was less emotional than this actor and lets just be honest, no one can come close to David Suchet's portrayal of Poirot."
A3CWVTH1M1ZP85_19155,"the film is slow drama but interesting.
the acting is good.
willem seems to take on parts which are challenging.
video has artifacts and grainy."
A17ES880Y0XLWE_8609,"There is a hole in the front of the cover, I assume from shipping but other then that, all good"
A2HR76QEWVUCHP_17661,Amusing with a great ensemble cast.... Donald Sutherland has some good catchphrases.... Clint East\wood makes it cooler than it deserves to be...
A1L69B5HNACFDB_18394,i was under the impression that was the entire 1st season and it certainly was not. this product was described incorrectly and dishonestly.
A3Q3OZS1MCTSK9_8081,"Fantastic movie!!  I can't tell you how cute this movie is, I love it so much."
A21A17T3TG912R_4575,this was such a great movie! i loved it! i think it is the best chipmunk movie ever!
A2SH72FGQWSP7J_8679,"Good plot, good people, a lot of suspense and action.  I only gave it 4 stars because the 5 have to be reserved for the really great movies like Avatar."
A1V9EJF0SXASKI_4681,"Brilliant story of a very successful assassin and the police work to locate and stop him- before he kill Charles de Gaulle. Tight, exciting movie."
A4YP8C4QHU2I1_15035,I like this kind of spy thriller. It takes some different imagination and approaches. Highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys spy movies.
A5NEZVH42F77F_21064,Watched this film growing up and enjoyed it. Kenneth did a lot of low rated films. Some good and some bad.
A1F2KMOJODK21X_12964,"Thin plot, too fantastic to follow or accept. Quite unlike Sir Arthur's original Sherlock but more like a pre Harry Potter wannabe."
AZOPRBMG6KDFW_16358,"Much funnier than the remake Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, Niven and Brando exchange brilliantly funny dialog.  The quality of the transfer is blurry and second rate."
AOGADSBO6UYY1_21477,"Made the mistake of ordering the BOOK when I was seeking the DVD!  Must return, but am weighed down by other projects this week.  Arrived promptly and in good condition."
A2Y8LYW4CBCM5P_6967,Everything promised. Speedy delivery. Thanks! Sorry for the delay in posting. Computer problems. Great movie
A5L5CYL49AIW2_10311,music was excellent and costuming as well however I thought the plot could have been developed more in the area of sibling interface
AFBQ4RK2VGZR1_23524,"Weak story, poorly acted. Redgrave and Fox are exceptionally bad. Tedious. Two hours of my life wasted."
AL1BTL9N79UU2_18585,Feel good to watch old animation created by human hands. All plastics but nicer than some recent ones like Trash of the Titans.
A3DQG3U3XKUG5M_6913,"Christian Bale is so violent in this movie, but he always has a smile on his face, poor Jared Leto though, it made me sad that he didn't survive!"
A3IAK9OG2U6BRY_2168,"This movie is a classic, Bronson at his best. Sad that most of the cast is gone now but they will always be remembered."
A1REWP2OSWSPJM_8773,This is such a sweet story.  I think it is just as good as the old classic one with Shirley Temple.
A1RV5KO737VP2T_13145,"The movie is funny enough, but the main reason to buy this DVD is for the pause function and the scene with Jamie Lee Curtis topless. Oh yeah, and Eddie Murphy is pretty funny, too."
A3CML1HXW542EZ_10336,I wanted something light to watch and decided to watch Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.  It brought back childhood memories. My kids agree that the child catcher is Scarry even evil looking.
A6X2TIJ9FVDTA_1051,"I love this movie!! The packaging was very nice, and my DVD's were delivered quickly."
A2L7X562CJ2522_7505,Love that she shows anyone can be whomever they want and change their life situation.
A2WZYNL39AA8JC_1832,Very well written. Wasn't this a true story. Beautiful scenery I think the older man on the rock fishing was a grandson of one of the boys.
A3636T2712221D_10626,OMG I got a VHS. It didn't say that when I bought so I haven't played it yet to see quality.
A1969SWAZMJ2E0_22433,3 FILMS. 1ST FILM IS DEFECTIVE.  LARGE AREAS WITH NO SOUND.  SOME AREAS WITH MESSED UP VIDEO ALSO. TERRIBLE.
A1V069KX8WX83T_7196,"Great movie, Robert Downey Jr. does a fantastic job portraying Chaplin. I can see why he was nominated for academy award for this role."
A88NZJZUAJ4XD_18250,Tess should not have had to be hung. that bastard she killed and raped her over again until she had no worth left.
A1D71VBP6Y9VRO_22549,MOVIE GOOD BUT OUTDATED JUST NOT SOMETHING YOU WOULD NOT WATCH 2016. IF THEY WERE GOING TO REMAKE MOVIES JAMES BOND IS NUMBER ONE ON MY LIST
A272SCP2RMAKQC_20971,It is dated and slow- moving. I lost interest halfway through and stopped watching it.
A1FQH7GDIQ7HES_8845,"Too scared to say I love it because it's so evil but you can't stop watching it!  Horrible!  Very well played--BP, MF KS amazing!!!  Does not leave you with a warm fuzzy feeling so viewer beware!"
A2LXGKKYDQZKIF_12433,"BUYER BEWARE: I got a sealed package and there were discs missing form both season 1 and season 2. Of the remaining discs, two of them were lose in the package and were severely scratched."
AV0SBCDP5U3C_15147,The color is terrible.  I don't know if it's a poor transfer to dvd or the film itself.  The color is so bad that at times it almost looks like a negative.
A1CG09UHHIT0VB_5354,"I really was pleased with the condition of the disc and time I received it.  My husband is a big John Wayne fan and the price was really good.

Pam Burnworth"
A3SZR6CHIMJ2J_8021,"Loved it as a kid, my kids were less impressed.  Good for the nostalgic but doesn't really work for my kids."
A3P8GK41KX27DA_23892,"Ok movie if you have nothing better to do.  Predictable, bad fight scenes, and an unbelievable ending.......and I don't mean unbelievable as WOW....I mean this is unbelievable as in Never Never Land."
A3MAZM138KFVOW_17502,"Good World War I military adventure where a German Zeppelin crew, when testing a new prototype, is ordered to perform an audacious raid against England.  The story in enhanced with an undercover agent who has managed to infiltrate the crew."
A18Z4PYBB9L9RY_5607,Good quality and love the extra feature. Very well acted. No much more to say but needed more words! LOL
A1KD8CHSA9ZFAO_20806,"My tween boys enjoyed it.  I still remember the original, and maybe I'm old... but the TV Show was better..."
A1TWFFJFMXLJO5_19960,"Bought it for my dad and he said ""It was a piece of nothing good, can't use his exact words!!"
A1OANNUCZ3HK6I_2339,"Great movie. I could seriously watch it everyday. If you do not buy this movie I will be forced to say... ""Ni !!!!!"""
A2U2OJCDRNQNBF_21234,Too predictable and lousy acting. The kid and the dog were the only good ones. John T. Seemed like he was on the skids.
A2TAAFL2CH550H_22398,Not a great movie...but okay.  The actors are not very interesting...the acting is so-so.  I would not recommend this movie for those who seek a lot of action.  It's more like a Disney type film.
A2C21DQ4FQARGV_22997,The movie is a big blob. It was nothing dangerous about this movie. The kids were cussing and fighting. That's about in every movie. The only good thing about this movie is Coolio's song Gangster paradise. That's it.
A14W3J8FCKYQO5_8748,"Oliver Stone leaves out important information and gets some of his facts wrong. In trying to show a conspiracy, this film takes liberties with historical information. Overall, this is an entertaining film - and nothing more."
A3O830XO65DMV5_21960,"Some inappropriate material scattered throughout that could have been left out, sexual innuendos, behavior, and language.  Made it difficult to watch with my tween.  Entertaining otherwise.  Would not watch it again."
A1RJUL9AVLWC0U_6865,There was nothing redeeming about this film -- American Psycho.  A waste of time.  Gratuitous porno with no discernible plot.
A2OO2VP12TIQZN_11641,"If you wish to see an old fashion Sci-Fi movie that will help you to sleep through this move, then this is it"
AW1UJD60GG0RH_12130,"Good actors and performances, excellent plot.  Well worth the time if you are a Sherlock fan."
A15I8JXQYS3YKJ_5329,Great John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn movie.  They are fantastic together with super story line and lots of none stop action....must see !
AVB6L8EU6L3F9_11954,"Along with Carousel and the King and I, surely it's about time that these musicals are given the honor of being available on Blu-ray.
What's the reason for the delay?"
A1UAHK8DRBTSK8_20830,sadly this series is NOT captioned for the deaf. So I didn't enjoy it at all. I fast forwarded it. Since this was a new anniversary edition it could have been captioned or subtitled for hdmi. Its not.
A1JHC5YJD92EX9_14857,"A great story about a ranch family and hard luck, and family conflicts in Texas.  Acting by Newman, the old man, and Neil is superb.  Might be to depressing for some."
A2GGB5O6W6D8QN_9108,I seen the movie when i was younger it was awesome then and awesome now. Need i say more :}

A3L53MFRK4DU4Z_3309,"Scooby Doo Camp Scare. My granddaughter (18) is collecting a lot of the old classics.  She still loves them. New Scooby Doo cant
 compare."
A2W0KXDW71PP7Z_7628,Our sons had a black lab that they dearly loved and have been grieving over his death.  This DVD is endearing to them because they can related to their lab like this boy related to his dog.
A1EX6Z7F0VSP3X_2614,"Surprisingly faithful to the book. Well-cast. Excellent performances by all, though I could almost see Susan Sarandon rather than Michelle Pheiffer in the lead."
A3EYI0IZOEXZ96_9482,This movie is based on a true World War Two story. I found it very entertaining with some great old time actors.
A29E9NRD4JF5UO_7467,"Bought these DVD's for my grandchildren, they loved it! The DVD was in excellent condition., and received promptly. Great for the granddaughters."
A18SH220KYV7OG_21668,Hated his friend the side kick to stupid for words. All the other characters were good actors.
AKBNUI8TB2YIC_1501,Milla is the zombie killing queen. This flick was her boot drive. She can jump in my shower anytime. Where can I get one of those dogs?
A1E0UL5T641R65_2279,"Monty Python!!! If you don't know the Holy Grail then ""I will spit in your general direction""! Funny each time I watch it."
AOQCR1MH556K6_23087,"Usually, the movies I order from you are very good. I liked this movie but, the quality of the dvd was very poor."
A36I7O0F69GITC_6300,"I like it, I feel bad for Drago died on the end all to stop a evil king."
A5F0YM6YOTFB2_18918,"Overall, this is a good movie that tells what went on with the Jews during WWII, and the stress and pressures that the Frank family and others had to put up with."
A27ZXPHVKGERFG_11850,"I can't believe this was made in 1989..............looks more like a 1930s movie , except  for the actors.
The movie itself was blurry at times."
A11BXVCQNX5OKP_20267,Otto P's musical was a bit stiff and the dialect of the actors manufactured for a white audience.
A1MG4UL9CI136Q_20599,I thought it was entertaining and cute . I enjoyed it Samuel Jackson is always good. I didn't have to worry about things in bad taste.  Thumbs up!
A2Z3VJ7P1J9I00_9606,"Pacino's performance is worth watching. Plays Satan. Keanu Reeves is OK as kind of ""Mr. Natural"" Florida litigator. But script and directing not worth it"
A34OD5GD02R6KN_18089,Interesting to see a Viking in King Arthur's court - just like in the comic strip series from earlier years that I use to read every Sunday in the papers.
A1D44U2MPO993M_2582,"Very slow and very beautiful. Read the book if you relish irony. Daniel Day Lewis is, as usual, wonderful. Michelle Pfeiffer is also good. Winona Ryder is miscast."

A1IB5SONIH59C_23911,"No subtitles and no closed caption!  That is discrimination against hearing impaired.  The liberal film industries hated the hearing disabilities, and they forced our hearing impaired people to be illiterate!  Don't buy these DVDs without subtitles!"
A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_1423,"Fun Film,80's teen genre/vamp movie. Quirky and silly and not too scary, I noticed Amanda Bearse is in it before married with children, it's A fun witty movie so it's not the scariest."
A2XZ06A13I0S16_8667,Contact is an interesting movie with lots of scientific facts some fiction of course. Very entertaining. The ending was a bit weak but still overall very enjoyable.
A1LCEJMBC630OJ_19782,"Another Amazon rip-off, selling a DVD-R as a DVD.

Amazon is doing this more and more. BUYER BEWARE.

Amazon should at least identify format, at top of page, as DVD-R."

A1UBJNUCJ2KYH1_3349,"This is one of my favorite Leslie Nielsen movies. It takes a fun look at Dracula and vampire movies, and the cast is great. If you like comedies, vampires, and Leslie Nielsen this is a must get."
A1QI6PI0HH4H0P_11029,"This is kind of like the movie ""The Secret"", but instead of having many authorities on the law of attraction, there's just one - Mike.  His rise to success is interesting.  There's nothing groundbreaking, but I did enjoy his story."
AVV5JGLBZERCM_7055,"Just as much a smart violent thriller as a critique of American attitudes towards veterans and foreign affairs, First Blood's impact spawned both necessary thoughts on our society as well as an everlasting character in Sylvester Stallone's John Rambo."
A3U59Z0TGYD80Z_5094,"To Kill a Mockingbird it one of my favorite movies.
Gregory Peck and other cast members make this a great movie."

A1SRWWY6KH8OTO_22876,"I have seen this movie many times.  It was a 4.5 star movie in its day, but has drifted because of its age, and reflects the time when it was made with great accuracy."
A21GGD9JZ189H0_5231,Good movie one of my favorites. And it looks great on Blu-Ray and the sound is great 5.1 sound. what more can I say.

A10LEXY2GOUDTF_9115,"I wouldn't classify it as entertaining.  It's dark and gloomy.  A good chance to see these actors in a film early in their careers.  As a 'cult classic', I can at least say that I've seen it."
A2XG0VVD5WOTX4_19309,I thought it was very slow moving for the first half of the movie but it picked up its pace at the very end.
AUZF6JFWU6LLS_14719,I liked the series up until chapter 5 that has five minutes of broken up signals. I guess that is what happens when they copy from TV.

A9Q28YTLYREO7_13746,not much of a film now. Very slick&shallow.very much a 80's film. The music was catchy. But the film is very dated now.it was average at the time. And hasn't changed.
A1VZXPSRTFAHR0_17856,"I would have expected way more picture quality from a Blu-Ray.  Performance is adequate but cinematic choice leaves much to be desired, IMHO.  I would have p[referred a ""5th row seat"" view."
A7O79UEZZTMVM_22981,"This movie was alright, never seen it until recently. Blu-ray looked an sounded good for a movie from the late 70s."
A2S8MLZTOQ67BH_21295,"This review is not for the film....the film gets 5 stars...this review is for the fact it states captioning....and there is NONE
Very aggravating! I would not have bought this if I knew that"
A16FZ4XGAJVF87_23462,"It's a great film, and the 3-D was pretty good, but the image suffered from ghosting. In other words, both of the stereo images were visible, one ghosted in the background of the other, which limited the 3-D somewhat."
AX36THIHPNPZU_6515,"THIS WAS A VERY WELL DONE MOVIE. I LOVE ANNETTE BENNING IN THIS MOVIE,AND AIDAN QUINN."

A11RCGZGVXFPPV_16559,So glad to have found all these amazing Claymation Classics. This is a longer video than some of the others he has and the picture quality is actually very good.

A3AGU38CRGN5JJ_7164,This movie starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe was very suspenseful and entertaining. I highly recommend it to ghost buffs.
AF918PUAFXMHK_3070,This is great. Demi Moore in HD on my big screen. FAP FAP FAP I was so hard throughout this movie. I feel like Burt Reynolds.
A1Z4JEDIYTVBUE_976,"There was 3rd encounters. A playful yet sometimes psychotic look at a group of humans encountering extraterrestrials. They make contact, they communicate and the return some people they borrowed."
A2088ALML6ZTGY_1041,"This is a cult classic movie about an unexpected event - close encounters of the third kind. When it's on DVD, this is a must for your collection."
A1NW4OOKRF8AX0_13825,Had it DVD loved the movie so much had to get the Blu-ray. My only regret was it didn't come with HD
A2BETUW68JTJRI_19349,"A bit corny and predictable, but I bought it for Leonard Nimoy, probably the most interesting character in the movie.  Plays a good ""bad"" guy."
A2FW53YM4T6D47_2848,"Whew!!!  A little disconcerting, especially the Mother/Daughter relationship.  Is this David Duchovny pre- or post- X-Files? Watch out...nudity & liberated sex initially."
AW54VHNI1HKSY_17870,Oh horror! Mono sound track????? If you're going to restore this epic (and it's a great transfer visually) find a magnetic stereo print or at least tell us in advance that it's mono sound.
A3J8ABVGK7ZL6H_22174,"I wouldn't waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in. This guy is a complete and utter psychopath!"

A1V1S9VVL2JMS0_7314,I love this movie and HAD to get it when I saw it on blu-ray. its a classic Arnold movie!
A277HPW7B49PAO_8024,"This is a MUSICAL, much more so than the recent films.  Every five minutes is a song.  It is entertaining but...eh.  I like more dialect than song."
AA1AM20M8BWTG_9012,"A great movie just don't like this version of it, does not have the narrative, which helps move the story"
A2N6J64F668EY2_819,This movie is simply stunning. An awesome commentary on the world in the 60's and very expertly shot. Don't pass this one up.
A3AK2AHTUZ8BSP_3648,I enjoyed this movie since I was a small boy. It also has a colorize version in it.
A3F31WV27FJMFM_20952,"This is a great little film, but Alpha's print is just miserable to watch.  More splices than you can count."
