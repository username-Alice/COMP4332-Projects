AWYITJ9IUMYKH_524,"Two Wolfgang Petersen directed films together in one package is all you could want, with fine picture quality and all the extras from the old DVDs.

""Air Force One"" in particular is excellent.",5
ANDZLSFNII2EW_12768,"For fans of the series and the movies
this film is a must. It continues The
Wrath of Khan but not at the same level
of interest. Anyway is a good movie",4
A1A2GP9SM4GCPD_10310,"I love the movie. The Blu-ray was fine, but it came with an expired Digital copy code. So that was disappointing",3
ARJIJNFNT2YSY_15036,You don't know what is going on until the end of the movie.  I have seen other movies that you don't know what is happening until the end but this leaves you cold.,3
A1ZYPLIM0YWSJR_8549,"We only watched a few minutes of the movie, due to offensive content.  We had wanted to see it, because wee had heard of it many times.",1
A3U89LAY00TDDD_15379,"Watch out, there is no digital copy with this - that is so annoying in this day and age.",1
A1EAHESWT2OS72_10685,States in the description multi-format. IT IS NOT!!!!!! Just the blu-ray's. The reason i bought it was for the digital copies!!! Very disappointed to say the least. I feel i was ripped off.,1
A2Q5RE6BNNJBR4_8236,A rare classic! Real life and cartoon made to look like one world at the same time. Awesome.,5
A133QQMQDF7NJP_9289,I did not hate the movie but the DVD was terribly scratched. What more can I say I simply threw it away.,1

A1VKS4ZTOJR3FX_23448,"Bought this movie because i've read the book. It was ok, not one of my favorites. IF you are a fan of the time period then you will most likely enjoy this movie.",3

A1MEHGGDU1ETXZ_17539,"Too much dialog, story line hard to follow. After a while did not care about plot or movie itself. Goodfellas was a good mob movie.",1

A1P0KA6BLPXB4T_5375,"Such a great movie! We laugh all the way through it. I saw it when it first came out, but it has a similar storyline to Did You Hear About the Morgan's (sort of).",5
ACTSOF7OLCCMZ_17298,"I do like Jeff Bridges.  He's undoubtedly made better movies, and lots of them, but this is worth your time, if you like him.  Valerie Perrine is no hindrance.",3

ASTCW3T1X28A3_14665,"I love it because there is plenty of action and it speaks to the thesis that I cover every year in my 12th grade class; science vs. religion.
In addition, students really love it",4
A3HCI92REOEXGD_15188,Henry Fonda is great and the history aspect is correct. The movie is just not action packed enough for my taste.,2
A2MUMWNRBK9W0E_8967,"Nicely suspenseful, but not exactly brain food.  Still, it's entertaining; at least the good guys aren't TOO good, and the bad guys aren't TOO bad, at least until the end.  It keeps you guessing for a while.",3

And no i do not recommend this movie.",1
A2KVAHYR78KZHZ_12787,"Just seeing Christopher Lloyd as a Klingon makes this film worth watching. Oh, and Robin Curtis as Saavik was way better than Kirstie Alley.",4

A15K1U8PVHIONE_20742,"Generally, this is a lumbering history of some Siberian families through the years to present times and the  loss of the tundra. It is very long and cannot be presented in one sitting.",3

A3M5A4BP513G37_4065,An inspiring true story about coping with a handicap. Another plus for this story is teaching those of us who aren't handicapped how much we can do to help others by accepting them. How brave they are!,4
A1WUBQX476A9XL_11931,Foolish nonsense that not even Kerr and Niven could salvage.  I had heard about it as a classic all my life -- classic rubbish.  Otto Preminger at his worst.,1

A3GZAR2QN62JWY_12478,Didn't like this Burt Reynolds flick as much as his older ones. His career was winding down and his voice was kind of soft and not as  manly as in his previous movies. Bandit was his best flicks ever.,3
A1KD8NJPZ01R37_18316,"The acting is so completely bad, it's actually a tone for the whole movie.

New York accents all done by non New Yorkers and done in the worst way, all in uniform.

Awful. NO STARS",1

APUHDJ6QURQIM_21736,Even by seventies standards this was pretty cheesy. Westworld (the 1970s version) was much better.,2

Saw it on TV - have now erased it.",3
A2EEAP46EBTUSP_22497,"The progression of Mark Jameson is handled really well. The ending is a bit weak, rather anticlimactic. The Enterprise crew seem kind of background in this one, like they aren't even really needed for this episode.",3

AMFIOAX06DD2E_17793,"A very thin plot and barely credible ""alien"" combine to overwhelm a reasonable performance by Ms. Lords.  Production quality is solid, however.",2
A1N0LCPR7O7OLL_7343,This is a true science fiction film directed by master filmmaker Paul Verhoeven.  Arnold does some of his best acting and Sharon Stone delivers in a pivotal supporting role.  Right on par with Robocop and Starship Troopers.,5

What's up with that?????",3
A6N70B0B6O8XE_17526,Try as I might I just never rated Predator 2 and seeing it again recently confirmed it. A decent actioner type movie but really doesn't hold a candle to the first one. I thought Predators was actually better than this.,3

A3E750R9HRRER_10031,"While I'm a fan of Robert Mitchum's and can take John Wayne in some roles, this movie just didn't make the grade. The writing is very bad, the directing is mediocre and the acting is sub par.",2

AGZ0DYC6CRRXC_18845,The soundtrack played so there was music but no voice track!  I ordered a second copy and that didn't play the voice track as well...beware!,1
A2YTQ5BGQX3ZCL_3258,"Not anywhere as funny as you would expect from these two. More satirical than belly laughs, kind of like ""History Of The World"". Certainly not in a class with ""Blazing Saddles"", ""Spaceballs"", ""Young Frankenstein"", and the ""Naked Gun"" series. Disappointing.",3
A2D73O2IU87EYB_17527,A movie well done.  Just not my cup of tea.  Mob movies set in the early 1930's.  Acting is great!,3
A3UGYBSUG08FUS_7741,I really like this movie.  I have watched it lots of times and it is good as the first time I saw it.  Blu-ray is even better.  Great price,5
AUU1KXUT7KPPN_6361,"Wonderful, and sweet.  One of Julia Roberts best.  Hugh Grant is great also.  I love this movie.",5

A3ML5FMKR2OS1U_22542,"Interesting- geared to the video game generation, I think- but pretty much a coming of age Bond movie.",3
AQHCBEDGWV2ZT_16665,They don't make them like they used to.  Not sure if that is good or bad - but an enjoyable flick regardless.,4
A258MSMKY2710V_4976,this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. i hope a special edition comes out soon. there is a good chance because it has become very popular.,4

ALS2LB854HCDJ_10417,De Niro always fun to watch.  The story breaks down into too many unrealistic car chases.  On and on.,3
A2CKMW9ZS4HE60_11009,"Love the movie and so glad its on dvd, great to watch and see this movie. Just wish it had a main menu instead of going right in to the movie.",4
A2V55J9CCQCOG0_1184,This movie is still great after all these years. The plot line is thought provoking and still relevant. Demi Moore is great. I enjoyed showing it to my teenage daughter who appreciated it as much as I always have.,5
AWE3KRBG43OEF_7560,I am simply in love with Lilo and Stitch. I just can't get enough of it. I love the sequels and the TV show.,5
AUTJOGLQPXPMP_8969,I enjoyed watching this movie from the comfort of my living room.  My eyes were glued to the television.  It was packed with action from the beginning to the very end.  The ending was satisfying.,4
AWDGGMDI3217R_8983,My wife and I wanted to watch the original movie prior to viewing the sequel and as a result did not watch the sequel.  The plot and the characters seemed one dimensional and bottom line did not like the movie.,2
A35DG9KDVHL20V_17256,"I was VERY disappointed in this rip-off of Vaughn Bode's characters.  Even the animation is low-level, done better in crayons, in my opinion.",1
A1H1WP5HQBMZHJ_11578,Excellent movie.  Lori Singer's needed a few acting lessons prior to filming but Julian Sands is perfect as the warlock!,4
A3PF3XRY0ITDAL_5433,THIS IS A GREAT MOVIE . IT IS ALSO FUNNY. I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME FINDING IT. NOW I WILL BE ABLE TO WATCH IT WHEN I WANT.,5
A3JJ21YCMGSKGH_955,"1977 saw the release of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind, and I was lucky enough to see it in the theatre. Once you see it, you'll never forget it. For it's time the special effects were awesome.",5
A2WNPC6V93MMPU_3630,A great comedy! Also a good combination of actors and actresses. This is a movie I plan to watch again and again.,5
A2NKO8BSARTXMM_7052,Good movie of a special forces soldier antagonized until he declares a 1 man war on a small town. Lots of action.,5
A3VKZQLHPCEICH_19788,"Did not care for this movie.
Seemed to be something lacking, not sure what.
I usually like most things with Angela Lansbury.",2
AUNCP6KHK0DI3_7322,Fun movie they would not have done a remake if it wasn't.  It is Arnold so if you have a big issue watching his movies your looking at the wrong one :),5
A9XXISPE87JVE_20622,Entertaining. Especially the young Kevin Spacey looking like he's wearing eye shadow and Denis Leary is in mid-90's comedy riff mode. Judy Davis does a nice job as well.,3

This is a silly rule : Must write so many words!!!!",4
A3LHCCONMPAT89_8936,"Even though this movie won lots of awards, I think it is Clint Eastwoods worst.  I threw it away after just watching one third of it.  It is rude, crude and nasty.  Don't waste your money and your time.",1

A2E3B7Y6DSCXXA_16664,"Hubby like it, teens thought it was a bit slow, and silly.
The second to Fletch (as far as I know) they thought it was about the same, silly, but slow.",3
A3HSWL2RVZ61LI_7460,"If you like good, decent, family-oriented DVD's, this is one to buy, keep and share! Not only Doris, but all the actors do a great job! I was sorry when I had viewed the last episode!",5

A3U8GKA2JYA3GE_19359,The DVD did not work and I have to return it.  This is the second time I received a defective DVD.,1
A1QXGU779RQUD8_11404,Find a Blu-ray restoration of it. The DVD I found was one of those public domain VHS transfers that is intolerably grainy. Otherwise it is just FLiesher animation in its prime that isn't Superman.,3
A34H7ZKMPEMRED_15161,"The title is misleading (not the actor's fault, the cast was up to the task) but the battle was too large in scope to be covered without distorting it into a work of pure fiction.",3
A3GC48AS8GYPWD_1798,One of my favorite all time movies!  Brings out every family related emotion experienced by most.,5
A1NIPHCQHQ2LYY_21219,"Definitely a classic. Definitely a children's movie. Amazing Muppets by Henson & an interesting twist toward the end. Mediocre acting, mediocre character development.",3
A1ND8PQ0GRGJVZ_12691,"Not as scary as when i saw it in the theater.  Still a good picture, came in great.",4
A2418ZET66CQ0N_9886,"All too corny. It a shamed as Duvall is a real good actor, but not here.",2
A317DZH9ORM9JL_12280,"I love this movie, and the DVD was clean and free of the usual older transfers problems. The music was understandable, with no pops or hiss.",4
A5CYW5OL2T1J6_12069,A horror movie of a different kind that is a little hard to follow at times.  Yes I know you're not suppose to think too much into horror movies.  I can't help it though.,3
A1JB3ZW78YDP0K_8639,Paul Newman in his prime.  A few racy scenes which prevents anyone 16 our younger from watching it.  Definitely a must-see.,4
A3RQFHZ3ZI4QLY_14027,"It was entertaining.  Could have spent my 2 hours doing something better.. Oh, wait, I watched this while preparing dinner so it was okay for a lazy Saturday evening.",3
A387L9V9RZQAVP_18376,This was a purchase for my husband who has since passed. I don't care for Sci-Fi,2
A2TRWOYLGTZU0Z_7508,First Lilo was better. But like everything else if you watched the first one you'll want to watch #2.,3
A1IOR4C3BO5W6S_12597,"It is supposed to be a blu-ray disc. Granted the movie came out in the 80's so upgrading a old movie to 1080 is hard but cmon, couldve have done a much better job. Movie is very fun though.",3
A37CLGIRR8SCNG_13325,It was interesting. It's a One Time Movie. It was good enough to want me to watch all the way through.,3
A2BLT8RI2TK9FS_1046,No matter how often I see this movie I still end up a crying baby. Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts makes this movie go over the top... the little boy helps bring many laughs especially in screens that is wonderful.,5
A1YMYVORIFR9JX_12829,"future leaders of the world doing what they do best; rape, kill, steal  drugs, anything but get an education or a job, all glorified in this movie.

A24P4XOBMMD9IO_4000,"I like Connery's character so much that I was disappointed he died but, hey the movie is a great sci-fi fantasy.  Enjoy.  This is the original.  ""There can be only one.""",5
A19GNIXYN266KU_5068,Greg plays an attorney in this one. Not surprising because Hanoi Jane said he was a prick and most attorneys are pricks,5
A1Q0T8LHQ56IJ_1104,I've always liked this corny movie and for the price and Blue-ray you cant beat it. Go Arnold.,5
AYI3RRLZYQQR9_278,"My daughter likes this video... It isn't her favorite (she prefers Grover), but she enjoys watching it - Other posters complained about the bunny being rude - he IS short tempered, but it's more humorous than offensive (in my opinion)...",5
A1NKUJEY7TKODK_9820,Good and bad view of ships at sea.  Some are actual footage and some are obvious models.  Good story line and well known actors.,4
A1UYDPLYOQAJNH_1075,This was a wonderful movie.  It was very realistic.  There were very touching moments as well as sad ones.  It held my attention the entire time.  I definitely recommend it.,5

A3OYRNRI5NU7C_18685,"Nice intro of Reese Witherspoon. Rather slow, but it did develop the story plot. Sam Waterson seemed out of his comfort zone.",3
ACOWF75A05HZE_4920,Fantastic I got involved in this movie because my grand daughter was reading it in her HS English class. I enjoyed the acting and the story development sorry that racial relations haven't improved as much as they should have.,5

A3H8LFMMN5INQF_10615,It is fun watching an old black and white movie. I am sure that this movie was intended to appeal to those soldiers returning home after World War II.,4

AO4MAHAWB54Q4_17100,Photography stunning but the meaning of this film escapes me or was their a meaning?,2
A3AXIVYKIA642N_5339,It's an African Queen on the open range.  John Wayne and Katherine Hepburn are great opposites which compliment each other very well in a profound and humorous way.  A lot of wisdom in found in their dialogue.,5

A3R27T4HADWFFJ_77,This is one of the best Scrooge movies out.  Henry Winkler outdoes himself.  The casting is excellent and the music and theme old but very relevant.,4
A2FA1BTWGOW8JL_20101,"This movie is a good movie, and plays well, but just was in a plain jewel case, with no label or anything on it.",2
A2JVDLWQC0JXTJ_17188,"Normally I like romantic period pieces. Marie Osmond is the heroine in this movie - not the best of actresses. I could only endure the movie for about ten minutes, then finally gave up waiting for it to improve.",2

A1VIKEPP8GZS47_1648,Have watched this SO many times. Actually didn't watch when I rented it. Movies to me have a degree of artistic license. Luc Besson is most incredible. Viva la France! NOT FOR THE KIDS OR ANYONE THAT ABHORS VIOLENCE.,5

A3I8MEHKZDGVGM_19799,"Angela Lansbury did not have a very strong role here as Ms. Marple, which was rather unsatisfying, but it was okay. The big stars (Elizabeth Taylor, Kim Novak) were overacting but perhaps the script was the problem.",3

A3M6Z62LU2LH9C_16317,If you like classic slasher flicks this is for you. A good movie a little cheesy at times but I mean it's not going to when an Oscar but still worth a watch if you like these types of movies.,4

AVVK3WYO1TRZO_22544,I can't believe I watched it end to end. The entire plot line was predictable and obviously read from a script. I guess a nice break from mainstream Hollywood movies.,2

A39DEVSPIBDE2A_16899,"Great restoration.  But, it's pretty dated and doesn't hold up well 70 years later.

A2LII3BB40HVFZ_23507,This movie might have been timely when it was first released but it is now beyond its time.  These are 4 angry and easy black women that don't truly represent any black women I know.,2
ABMQTSJL33EDH_5039,A true classic.  Hard to believe Robert Duval did not have a speaking part in it.  Great transfer to blu-ray.  A bit wasted since it is in black and white.  Will probably look at it 2-4 times a year.,5

A38CRLZPTLPRQN_20966,Very predictable story line.  No wonder this is the only movie that Brando directed.  I do admire his acting work and there are plenty of 'pretty boy' shots in this movie; however his real talents were displayed in earlier works.,3

AKC8DYSUIILR3_15899,"I thought this was hilarious in the 80's.  It's not appealing or funny in the present day.  It doesn't stand the test of time, at least not by my standards.",3
AIU086G26Y83N_8511,Great romantic comedy with exceptional performances... however not for everybody who might be looking for something fast paced according to some friends with whom the movie was shared.,4

A1XNQ807HFGJH8_5547,"I'd say it's John Hughes' best movie. The DVD was good. Had some decent special features, most of it is reminiscing about what Breakfast Club means to everyone.",5
A1IAXJ6M3U4MPC_21967,I saw this back i the movie drive in . it goes full crazy with the underground city. but it is a long way from the worst movie I have watched and a longer distance from the best,3
A3CIR9TNWKVVWM_4692,This is one of my favorite movies.  Suspenseful and gives insight just how difficult it is to catch a motivated killer.,5

A8NS2ENQAXFPO_12337,It was pretty good. Brought back a lot of memories; Jack with hair and Ann Margaret. Not for the younger generation though; too tame!,4
A10F9JB1KGTMWA_18219,"Given the movie's age (and the age of the book it's based on), it's a worthwhile watch at least once, just to see how preposterous it all is.  Enjoyable though.",3

A3KL3MD77O5WZQ_12887,written & filmed as though somebody (the producers) didn't have anything to do for the evening. I would rather watch my oil; go down on my dipstick.,1
A3JX7HJOV6D4M4_14267,It is an awesome movie. I liked it as a teenager and I still like it as an adult. The underdog won.,4
AFX5HPM8GE66U_8466,"I like how Ah-nod is getting more sensitive in his roles as he gets older. Still tough and cool, but compassionate too. In places. Pretty entertaining movie",4
A1NZVSZD0FEFOW_382,What an awful movie!  It reached a climax and then went another 20 minutes.  Uma Thurmond doesn't have the charisma of Diana Riggs.,1

A3694AYJDLNJSC_6546,A masterpiece of suspense and subtlety with some jaw-dropping action sequences of man against nature.  The soundtrack is one of the best of all time.  Highest recommendations!,5
A17OPKZHYNBVCV_10543,I can appreciate this movie much more now that I am married with kids.  It's a whole different film as an adult.,4
A15GF98ACK7QZ4_11751,"Grandkids loved it, maybe more so when they are a little older.
Good quality Muppet DVD. Worthwhile for the proper age group.",4

A1T6GXMI42373L_20941,It wasn't a bad movie based on 1983 standards. It seemed that some of events within the movie were questionable and/or not well thought out.,3

A3I86L4OXK4CXV_567,1st rate thriller.  I muse at the one star ratings from people who probably find fault with everything in life that they did not create themselves....if they ever did anything,5
A23RC4SBMMVQ1Y_5270,"The original has it hands down.  I know a remake is around, but this version is by far the better in all ways.  The women actors are incredible.  Can't recommend enough",5

ACOPMVTZGQB0E_902,This is a great movie in that it is jammed with great actors and any movie that you are laughing one minute and crying the next is a winner to me!,5
AIOZHPBCOH5V0_6149,"A fluffy male-fantasy narrative engagingly acted by beautiful leads, supported by humorous character actors.  But the REAL show-stealer is Rhys Ifans as Spike, the slovenly roommate.  His performance alone makes the movie worth watching.",3

AM6HCVMKEXYW4_20468,"All of the acting was good in this movie, I just didn't care much to see Duvall walk around all day drunk and mean.
Mr. Jones and Robert Duvall should spend their talent on better ventures.",2
A2CYS44A322ZWX_16249,Disk 1 is very good with live performances. Disk 2 was not that great and is videos. I wanted the song Rosalita as that is the best song and is missing from latest DVD's.,3
A4P89LCBNOCS3_14412,Even though the jokes are a bit old.  But the actors have good chemistry between them.  It is fun to waste a couple hours to watch.,4

A2RMQW7RQ2VI6I_23788,"This movie was a complete letdown. They tried to cross Cujo with The Terminator. Interesting concept, but the script completely lacks any real oomph. Awful film. Lance Henriksen deserved better.",1
A1Q3478SH9DH82_17932,"Plenty of action, but anyone into crime drama and forensics will notice the glaring errors in this film.  Jamie Lee Curtis does a good character study, but the rest of the cast was merely fillers.",2
A3SPVZZ3P3HTYY_224,"Fast shipping, and Tape was in excellent condition.  Somehow these old shows are better in VHS.",5
A174LNCMOB7OIF_18335,"This film is somewhat dated but still enjoyable especially when comparing it to the Ben Stiller remake.  Danny Kate does ""bumbling"" beautifully.",3
A3KHRAZVV91AG3_14494,"Good action movie, but didn't like that he died at the end.  But action was good.",3
A91Y6ZKWEZL5B_11631,This movie reminded me of the good old not so super hero days. It is entertaining without all of the crazy special effects found in today's Sci-Fi movies. It was good to see young Helen do her thing.,3
A3600EP59PMKNK_8364,"Silly and inane on this level doesn't entertain as much these days for me.  The side story about the elimination of public transportation in L. A., a tragedy on so many levels, needed more emphasis, I thought.",3
AHQ338OMAV2SI_16981,"This film is a good old John Wayne oldie! He is great in this one, which takes place around 1814 in the South. The only problem is, it is in black and white.",3

AGCSBBI0JQRPV_7598,I love it! It's one of the best movies ever. Jodie Foster is so good at acting. And it has great plot!,5
A33UM7AINRJ5ON_11173,"This movie is hilarious!  It captures the jaded cynicism of the rock scene, but then reveals itself as the ultimate parody with dialogue that sneaks up on you.  On top of that, the music is good, too!",4
A1P6YZGFXEJOTT_13186,Pretty accurate portrait of f what life was like on Alcatraz and how the escape was planned and executed.,4
AH09GVB713085_15320,Although it says Blu-Ray DVD it needs a complete remastering to bring it Up to Par with true Blu-ray as the colors are faded and the details are poor in this addition.  Very sloppy job.,3

A1X054KUYG5V_10092,"The Bottom Line:

Though Matt Damon's Tom Ripley is not nearly as interesting as every other actor/character around him, the movie succeeds in being interesting for 135 minutes and is a worthy thriller.",4
A1AOZNC4A8SX12_23796,Pretty good movie. Those pilots went through a lot to get to where they wanted to be.,3
A32J6157SYD9HJ_15410,Psychological thriller. A blind woman is manipulated by a crew of thieves. You can feel her confusion and fear. Audrey Hepburn gives a great performance.,4

A2A967XIIET645_6270,"It is a little stiff and slow to start, but the roommate stole the show (for me). I laughed so hard at his antics all through the movie. Ending was nice.",4
A2UBTMZRMMIVKB_21602,the film was very grainy if I would have know that would not have bought it but my favorite version of lone ranger,3
A1CA7HCD9BBTG_3209,"I heard this from a teenager who wants to know everything about the world.

After I saw this movie, I hated the doctor character. The depiction about love is very shallow. Plus, I don't understand the transition he made.",3
ANBEHMFDIPCJ6_4450,"So underrated - very funny
Beware: this is a very confusing and possibly problematic movie in terms of gender, however, still funny in its own sense and worth watching to problematize issues",5

A1SQGWU0IN7XYB_3117,Worth watching if you're a fan of any of the actors.  Leslie Howard died in a plane crash during the war so it's especially moving,5
A9UWOLOQEP3M6_14453,"I remember how much I liked Romancing the Stone, so I thought I'd enjoy this movie. Wrong.  This movie is just awful.  Too much of everything and nothing good at all. I really disliked this immensely.",1
A3C1AFH1VX5VJV_20905,"Enjoyable, but not a classic.  Animation good but not Walt Disney.  A fun film.  Now we really know what Barney was doing when Andy read Barney's letters to Floyd the barber.  Barney was supposedly out of town.",3

A1F05Q4OPY3GEI_3827,I love the music and the actual movie by the same name.  I am not Jewish but I understand their beliefs.  Diamond's music is one of the top names on my musical list.,5

A1L2DLWYRNHKDR_16499,"Apart from the atrocious '50s musical background, this was a decent Western. The characters of Spencer Tracy and Richard Midmark are the two most complex and interesting, driving the storyline. Worth watching.",4

A39T0L7SX0BQ8R_19223,I use shows like this to sleep. There is something about a lecturing tone that makes me sleepy. I have never stayed conscious through more than 10 minutes of a show but I am sure it's good.,3
A7KI9YDV77P8I_15631,Love the original series. The DVD's are good and the picture quality is good... but the packaging is awful. They could have done a much better job.,4

A3U5LKYEK28YKE_11610,I've loved this movie since day 1.  I've seen it probably 100 times or more.  Plenty of cheese for the vintage film nerds like me.  Tim Thomerson plays Jack Depth perfectly.,4

A13PCJSIRWAKHE_20715,The first movie had a kind of edge to it - funny and scary. This one lacks both. The leprechaun is neither as funny or as scary as he was the first time around. The plot is quite forgettable.,1

A232X0RII9SUZ8_5383,This is a budget film but it's based on a great book.  The early Don Cheadle is superb in the role of the teacher who has to teach a wrongly-condemned man a 'lesson before dying'.,5
A1SDW6QF5BJA91_16903,If you are old enough to remember WW II then you may enjoy this movie. Younger people may find it difficult to believe.,3

A36X6YRWEQQ7PW_5672,What a fun way to go through World War 2. John Belushi just adds to the outlandish fun. I never thought of California as being affected by the war.,4
A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ_19257,I love country music. The music in this film is utterly boring. The story is utterly nonsense. The rest is totally boring. Couldn't get through half of it barely and didn't want to even fast forward the rest.,1

good for the time of filming.",4
A1ISP282U0TP15_9418,A very good oldie. As usual Mitchum is able to hold the story interest.  Compulsion: The acting was good and the story also was good. If you like Hichcocks movies this will be one for you.,3
A14L2115HZJCRX_11247,"This movie isn't very believable, but it is funny and romantic at times. Worth a watch if you have nothing else to do.",3

A7G17MTYTV5F1_16845,"I'm still a fan of the series, but I think this one needed a bit more explanation. While the Ape were in power, the remaining humans had mind control abilities. Why couldn't they use that power on the apes?",3

A2QNJARWTF9H89_23269,The first Oblivion was a funny culty movie.  This was not.  There aren't really any redeeming qualities here.  It took up the first six minutes with a summary of the movie.  Everything after that was just a waste of film.,1
A2RXZ8HIJ8ENOU_4731,"Classic.
An Oldie but a goodie. This is one of those LITTLE MOVIE""S""  that the star made. Not his/her most acclaimed, but one that is truly entertaining and indicative of the talent of the performers and directors. Worth the time.",5

A22UKIRL6GFX55_6530,"A realistic enactment of life in suburbia, or at least some of it.  Great acting from all sides.  It's a movie worth watching.",5
A1W94ZA1BJNZ9R_6352,Julia Roberts is one of my favorite actresses. No matter who or what she does she is the best. Her smile is so great,5

AF1FC152SNRDM_22775,Like a so  TV comedy. Tired dialogue delivered with the best of intent by capable actors. Barf me. Choose something else.,2

And when it came out on BD.
I decided to buy it.
Any fan should be satisfied",5
A2VD1KF09XPXD1_19071,We were extremely disappointed with the quality of this DVD. It was out of focus and blurry through the entire movie.,2
A2K3PRHZ19ORES_20819,The concept is cute but it's not very family friendly- there's a fair amount of unnecessary cussing. I wish script writers could find a more imaginative way of writing than to rely on foul language.,2
AILV4CXK8LEBV_18200,"Fun movie, saw it as a kid, still kind of holds up today...probably will see again",3
A30INYJM4XKY8Z_19499,This DVD would not play on my DVD. The error message said I was in the wrong region or something. Had to send it back.,1

A2B8DJ0CKN9FAO_15097,Not even Richard Pryor can save this dismal flop sequel to the Superman series. Didn't anyone tell the writers that slapstick is dead? Superman must stop an oil typhoon from stealing the oil of the world and defeat his super-computer.,1

DVD! It has not yet shipped. This is irresponsible business

dealing.",1
A2NDI8P5MD74SZ_3386,"A truly perfect movie. It shall be pity if you miss. Actually I'm a fan of Jean Reno, but this is really one of his best and also not a well-known one. Why don't they release the DVD version of it?",5

A2ZYOX83Y8G1QG_14730,I never saw this in the 80's. I guess it would have been more appealing to the 20 year old me back then. Just thought it was ok and her dress was awful.,2

And I am so happy to have it on Blu-Ray.
A real joy to watch.",5

A2VUGFOMJ41G43_17853,EXTREMELY UPSET!!  Got it today. Can't even watch it. IT is ALL SCRATCHED UP!!!  Plays credits and skips to end scene.  Good Grief. At least check your products before selling them to people.,1
A2M1NIC3WYYZN4_1510,I love this movie. It has more depth to it compared to other Steve Martin movies. It's a sweet love story based on Cyrano D'Bergerac but with a happy ending.,5

A1X054KUYG5V_12444,"The Bottom Line:

A faithful retelling of Stephen King's page-turner, Firestarter hits all the notes of the novel without hearing any of the music; simply a mediocre film, it's entertaining enough without being any good.",3

If you enjoy car chases, this has plenty.",4
A3M0HJRGYJBJJM_8564,This was purchased after watching Shutter Island. I wanted to compare the two.  This one was more realistic AND more frightening.  No one compares to Jack and I do like DeCaprio but both were good movies.,4

A9Q28YTLYREO7_5831,this film works because of the Characters being in tune with one another. It's a solid straight forward 80's film. Nothing more or less. Judd Nelson and crew are a good fit for each other in this film.,4
A2K53OYO4JJO28_21461,Interesting mixture of home grown neighborhood boys grown up. The takes on the different personalities and how they turn out is a study in the interaction of personalities.,3

A37BTU85F17716_1296,This performance is one of the greatest performances ever filmed. DeNiro is just perfect here. Just perfect. And Scores scores again! That man has one incredible vision. I hope he lives forever! These two make a great team! Fantastic film!,5

A2WJ5RBF8DJK17_20363,i understand why Algren hated Hollywood for this.  Sinatra stinks and they tore the guts from the book.  Not as terrible as the adaptation of Walk on Wild Side.  Wish someone would tackle Algren's work with some artistic integrity.,2

A2FB8OAP9TGJKU_21762,I can't give this movie a 1-star because it was so bad it was entertaining.  Or was that just us entertaining ourselves?,2

AFI99FN19OIBA_7386,One of my favorites.  Had on VHS and decided to upgrade.  May only watch once a year but enjoy every time.,5
A3LOW2ZQGQXXSA_10628,Truck Turner is classic 70's action flicks at its best. Didn't care too much for Hammer; Fred Williamson's made better movies than this one.,4
A31ZD8BLBN7QAJ_9420,by far the best Pok?mon movie and I saw it in the movie theater when I was a child. Now my daughter loves it.,4
A1TS45JWJVOSSW_17339,"Our kids love this movie and the dvd was perfect in playing it.  It is not a movie I care for much, but when it is on...the kids laugh until they buckle over.",3
AYD66PXUK9O12_20921,I believe I've seen this before and it might be great for some. I just didn't connect this time.,3

A7F82MBG7ALBH_6488,"I found out that this movie, which I saw many years ago, doesn't appeal to me now.  I can't say anything negative about the cast, which is wonderful.  The storyline, as I said above, holds no appeal to me now.",2
A3L1W5NM9VZ3AC_10738,Liked the first Speed.  This one doesn't pick up on any of the characters in the first one and just isn't believable.,1
AFS380RQDENLX_12645,This is in the top 100 worst films of all time. I didn't even read the cartoon in which it was based on.,1
AEW205G3VQXYY_19077,A slow moving movie. Way too long and could have been condensed to make it more interesting. If you have 4 hours and keep up the interest then watch it.,2
A7F6R4VBPHCLJ_12287,This was a Christmas gift for my brother.  He loves Laurel and Hardy and so do I.,4
AJNEGTHRLZ24I_7691,I'm a huge Julia Roberts fan so I love the part where she gets all dressed up.  OMG I wish women still did that.,5
A1LNEPQV8CTELK_17473,Disc badly scratched both sides and film not sharp. Looks like copy from vhs tape despite bring digitally remastered.,1
ANEHGYS727SZE_9717,"Loved the book.  Olivia Goldsmith is a wonderful writer, but the movie was only okay.  A couple of good laughs, but that's about it.",3
A3I6Y6Q8253BHO_5974,I bought this for my s on and he said that it was in good shape and that he enjoyed it.,5
AM9HMKRTIJL1W_9063,the saxophone slow haunting music through out the movie to me helped the movie  but the music missing in the final cut did nothing for me,2

A1L6T3ODA8J2H1_22019,I thought with these famous actors that this would be a great movie. I thought it was poorly acted. Didn't like it much.,2
A6UR51KJ0D2NT_5837,"Warning you will cry when you watch this movie! Those that have had to care for a sick parent especially. The performances are superb however, and the movie just seems to hit the right notes and felt real.",4
A2H6ZBVASGYWY7_1777,This was one of my favorites growing up and is now my Daughter's favorite.  Love Annie.,5
A1DUE15ZKTLOU3_12758,I guess I've just been too programed with contemporary movies to appreciate this as much as when it was released.,3

A12YYS6RVCNU6B_20939,"This film is just a continuation of so many other nazi films. It tells the same story, nothing new or different. It was just an ok film.",3
A27O781ZSVCR0P_21271,This movie would be fun for family viewing if the sleazy innuendo and foul language was removed.,3
AOSD8RV3XRHWJ_1090,"This movie will touch your heart in ways you never imagined, especially if you are a parent.
Beautiful, heartbreaking and enlightening, with a surprisingly refreshing end.",5
A2I3MWO1V0F36M_8554,One of the best vampire movies ever made. Tom cruise gives a terrific performance at least.,4
A3K5FOS80DGVV7_9355,We always watch this on the 4th of July. This two-disc version is excellent. The movie looks great and the extras are fun.,4
A2P8W3GZHVHAPC_22163,Not up to Newman's usual standards but worth watching if you are a Newman fan. I don't know what else to say about it.,3
A3PPZNPJ9VQXFL_2767,"Simply put, this is a very fun movie. Hoffman is at his best. DeNiro is great. No one overacts. Lots of laughs.",5
A1H7X2DPAQYKJA_19356,"Another classic old film, but okay.  A love triangle story.  If you like classical music, this film is for you.",3
A4MI7O1CEJQPH_20621,"I did not realize it was a region 2 movie, I cant play it or do anything with it.  I will pay more attention in the future!!!",1
A1JOU1MS2BMR5P_7089,this movie was a rousing tribute to all of those war vets that could find themselves fitting in when they came home....Stallone went downhill from here; Rocky is his only other claim to fame as far as movie making goes....,5
A23CSEON3LTVJ4_16889,"Well, for an older film this had some suspense to it....  At least I didn't Fall asleep...!",4
AJIONW38A1OVV_3705,"At least Neil Diamond had the good sense (or was it the audience response?) not to pursue his film career after this effort, but the soundtrack is a solid effort. Possibly his last essential album.",4
A1VDK6802Y3K55_8163,"My 5-year-old was really looking forward to watching this but she'd had enough of the movie after just a few minutes, with all the spitting, nose picking and fighting scenes we found it to be a huge disappointment.",1
A3UQ831F4LHLO8_22655,I gave this 3 stars because I thought this movie was going to be better than it was. It was slow-moving and there wasn't much excitement.  It is a rather strange movie.,3

A5PYA7IX4X3BP_3449,"Supposedly this was the best of the original series... It was pretty good, not like what I remembered as a child, but, bearing in mind that the graphics - for it's time- were good.. I'll give it 4-stars",4
A1UJQZ0KNM9U19_3324,"One of my kids and my favorite Scoobie Doo cartoon movies. Little scary for younger kids, but ok for 9 and 6yrs old.",5
A20OKVKPF23P6O_10331,"love the dog,  didn't hold my interest long enough for me to see the whole movie.  so that is why i only gave it an ok rating",3
A2BJURUTPLM7ZW_2891,I just love scary movie that have a really god plot and a lot of blood and guts they are the best,5
AJ4RGUEVA3MO9_14510,"Young Lions is good.  Brando, Clift and Schell shine.  Battle of the Bulge is not.  The German officer (inspired by Joachim Piper) comes across as a fanatic.  Desert Rats is just so-so.  Too many cliches.",3
A1VLCQNECMK793_21680,"The item is ok on its own.
Part of the movie was missed or scrambled.
Not the sellers fault but was made aware.
Offered to help but I declined.

AHGP7P2S50OW7_8415,"Great performance by Robin Williams and Matt Damon, Ben Affleck was mediocre due to poor casting.",4
A31X9O49RQUNZ1_13265,A simple-minded and dated film about prison and prisoners. My suggestion is to watch American Me or Runaway Train to see a little more realism. The widescreen DVD is good.,2
AJFP2BSUU9NR2_3767,I CAN VIEW IT EVERY CHRISTMAS ANYTIME I WANT....WITHOUT WAITING FOR TV TO AIR ONE ON THEIR TIME SCHEDULE. IT IS IN BLACK AND WHITE AND OH SO MEMORABLE.  I RECOMMEND IT HIGHLY.,5
A1TKV6TID7Q241_10221,"Poltergiest was alright. The only scary part was the part with the clown, but other than that it wasn't all that great. The Blair Witch Project was scarier than that. But it was neat and scary for it's time.",3
A254D6I4JABZYN_20082,It's just like the 90's cartoon. It was ok. Again if you really like the cartoon you will like this.,3
A27F0SZMT9YSIP_16209,"I don't remember this movie (1972) but the theme of Satanic boy (or girl !) is a little ""domed"" in your days of innocence lost, but...a good story a little too slow (boring?)....",3
A25502VZKL0U1B_14917,just what I expected a one sided account of an army that thinks it can do no wrong. Only watched it to make sure I was correct.,3
A7RCCWCG6GDD9_3536,This film needs no praise from me...It is simply charming and takes the viewer back to a time when movies were truly wonderful....,5
A2FHIZWME546SG_22228,80's B movie with cheesy acting & low- budget special effects... What more could you ask for? So bad it's good.,3
A1OJ4DT82V6EJ9_22279,"What a disappointment. If you've seen the trailer, you've seen everything worth seeing. Early in our viewing it ceased to be funny, becoming tedious and boring.",2
A3P5MDKSF28IZF_20970,Brando did a pretty good job of directing and staring in his move. I thank the cast around him did a better job. Especially Ben Jonson.,3
AJBRGZ78XZIT4_23476,"Great movie and story, great locations and effects. Maybe they didn't have enough money left for good actors/actresses? Worth a rental at least",3
A2JDCBUYK02G7L_2107,What can you say about Rumpole that isn't good.  The commentary by Leo Mckern really makes the product outstanding.  Mckern's appearance is comedic itself.,5
A6YOOD37UI7M5_13330,I just really liked the first 3 movies when I was a kid.  Jason is cool and the chicks are hot.  No other reason to buy these movies.,3
AHQ9XQQAOW9J0_15291,"Great romantic, revenge plot. Brandon and Malden at their best in this somewhat quirky period piece; with Brando directing you get another look at his special cinematic talent.",4
AKFTELCH8GLV7_5988,"Awesome movie w/Johnny Depp before he became Jack Sparrow, moved to France, and got too big on himself.  A wild ride and fun watch!  Gary Busey is in this too...",5
A2D25ROXJ9BGUF_11804,Don't listen to this guy if obscenity offends you. But he has quite a few very amusing little mannerisms and his timing is world class.,4
A31M69WDXIIX8J_2349,"This is the funniest movie ever... period.

My wife would not agree.  Maybe it's a guy-thing.

Hey Amazon - negative reviews from 12 years ago are not helpful. Can't you purge the reviews after so long?",5
A26H2IPTM5B2CE_1182,"Pretty good sequel to the original.  The only thing that was not good about it was the fact that it took away the mystery that the first one had.  More blood, more scare, and more cleavage than the first too!",4
AAC1G5QQYXTCT_16858,"VERY GOOD FILM ABOUT GANG WARS IN JAPAN...MICHAEL DOUGLAS , ANDY GARCIA, AND THE JAPANESE COP, PLAYED BY KEN TAKURA ARE ALL EXCELLENT!",4

A1Z3WPG7VLU76Z_4394,Tony Randall is always entertaining and this movie is no exception.  Full of laughs and entertaining to watch with all the family.,4
ADEXNCG6OZEQ3_3720,"Now this is the real Jimmy Stewart, watch it a hundred times (as I have) and it will seem fresh and new every time. Donna Reed is absolutely adorable and every man's dream wife!",5

nobody farted a lot, so I appreciated that. and It was pretty ok.",3
A3DPR3GJELMAMD_11730,I saw this video when it came out the second time on DVD.  I was moved and the dialogue was great.  Learning more than just the physics and biology and mix it with religion was refreshing and very informative.,4
AABZTK3UZZG3C_2048,"I've always loved this movie and not realizing I didn't have it on dvd, prompted me to finally buy it.",5
A2HX0JF7BT2RM7_9231,I enjoy this movie. I like Kurt Russell's acting so this was a no brainer for me. Even the worst movies are better with him in them.,4
A8KV7KFETKGT1_11291,I actually liked this movie. It has action and has funny scenes. I was entertained.,4
A1DUJCZJJBJO36_19148,It was very intense. A look into Ted's head. No reasonable explanation. He just did it to do it.,3
AKS94ZKF65TMF_12396,"I had ordered this movie as our family are big Christmas movie fans.  We watched it together and really enjoyed it. Fun movie and even if it's not really a ""Christmas"" film, it was really good.",4

A12DMIXQY2ID4V_11167,"It was funny, but not funny like ""Best in Show"". It's the same crew so the laughs are there but the laughs are subtle laughs.",3
A1B6IRUICQF283_20443,"Video fine.  AUDIO MUSIC is unbelievably WAY TOO LOUD.  Anyone who watches this classic movie will be disappointed.
Fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!",3
A20LK1LAVKME10_14025,thought it would be a funny movie.  too much sex and skin it .  sorry,3
A2DIFKCKSUZUVR_11238,would have given 5 stars but feed would stop a few times while I was watching. That's my only complaint,4
A30UDGFXN4JHDE_2313,That is all I know to say! Hahaha! My adult kids love this movie! Maybe I'm too old to understand it... But it's funny and weird all at the same time.,5
A3MN5U5RB7YR3P_8852,"This is an older movies but it still holds up very well. Morgan Freeman is the old veteran cop, and Brad Pitt, relatively speaking, is the impulsive rookie. Very tense thriller. Certainly a movie well worth watching",4
A1E2G7QGYYI01A_11320,Another old movie that blames radiation for the crisis. Excellent special effects for time  of production.,4
A13Y9AASBML1FT_20891,"I loved this as a kid, but after watching it again, it kind of terrifies me.",3
A8BXL886UNY1N_15158,"and still like it now. It was the groundbreaking series for the ""thinking"" type series. It made you think at the end of the episode.",4
A2POCYFLLGOQK3_13378,"Great movie just as he always does. Giving it a Bond type feel, with his moves. It was  easy to watch and enjoy. I would recommend to all !!!",4
A1F1EY8S6JS1QT_5315,"The movie is a fine sequel to True Grit, but the blu-ray is a revelation to look at.  Only extra is a theatrical trailer, but the film and its presentation are still very good.",4
A2JD9YDHLC76IB_11497,"this is one of the most beautiful movies I believe I have ever seen.
the story is deep and the ending, as all stories of unrequited love, ends sadly.
A must see.",4
ARA0SIFONTG3F_15030,Had you wondering what was going on. A simple movie about espionage. I would recommend this movie to anybody. Fantastic.,4
A1FJIRW8MIQOLW_9290,I never saw this movie until recently when it was playing on one of the cable channels- some of the humor is crude.,4
A1M1CPHJ2BXQ2R_9855,This movie terrified me for it could really happen.  Nothing about aliens or futuristic situations to scare you.  People right here on earth can be your worst nightmare as this picture showed.,4
A285RR5XUHK0MZ_19151,"Disc is scratched, movie skipped in spots, then froze and would no longer play about 15 minutes before end of movie. Very disappointed",1
A2EROXSSM3L11T_10273,I'd give this one a 4.5. Great combination of horror movie and revenge thriller set against a very Halloween-friendly backdrop. This has been a favorite of mine for several years now.,4
A2K42TGXAP8VDB_10040,very good movie.  of course we love john Wayne movies.  a little slow compared to today's movies but that is part of why we love them.  today things are a bit hectic.,4
AHIK7BUXFRMT8_1839,This movie is a timeless classic. I don't even know how many times I've seen it but it always comes through with great entertainment and leaves you feeling a little bit happier about being alive.,5
ALUWSFMBO6FZ9_19656,"I think most Mel Brooks movies are hilarious.  I would put this one at the bottom of the list of Mel Brooks movie's I've seen.  Still funny, but not hilarious.",3
AAP1JDX401YTC_11949,Good clean movie for everyone.  My family and friends enjoyed it.  Moral issues used that were good standards.  Gave to daughter as gift.,4
A203B9G839NCD6_18040,"It is one of the Porky's spin offs, not as good and gets tiring  fast.",2
A2Y29IRSI08F0I_21720,This is an ok movie but my kids have not asked to see it but once. Would not buy again,3
A1V0I4157HKPUX_14468,Not as good as the first one.  I do enjoy Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner pairing up for both of these films.,3
A1DJLUH6JQ1RHQ_7330,"Total Recall is a great movie.
This re-do bit is no big thing.
It is the same thing you got all ready.
Same time. Same everything.
Save your bucks..",1
A1ZER46LFWM6RF_15724,It is good to see some good actors when they were still young.  Good story with a real impact to today's world as it was then.,3
A2ERXSEJROQKAL_18069,Bought it for my collection of DC videos. Would not be fair to compare it to todays CGI movies that said the story line could have been better. Helen Slater is still beautiful seeing her on WBs Supergirl.,3
A1M9738QVSEWTB_21055,This is a Tarzan remake with a female main character. The story line is no bad but the action scenes were a little over the top. I felt rushed while watching this.,3
A1WBIIZ5KF7D6H_10762,Stupid special editions with the horrible CGI additions George added in the 1990s and even more later.  Still waiting for the originals on blu-ray.,1

A1U8KS6DLKI37O_15761,"This is a classic and I love watching it. Vincent D'onofrio was great as the mechanic/Thor in this film, brings back childhood memories.",4
A2SWRRNVKLMU8P_12368,"Cat people starring what looks like Harvey Kietel and Selena Gomez?
Whew! that's pathetic cover art! Great movie, but no way I'm buying the blu-ray with that high school art project on the cover!!!",4
A3OWV9S4MNOLIP_850,I loved the actors and the movie characters. Most memorable scene is the funeral in which the ladies share their feelings in a very sad situation,5

A2CKMDS10RKS50_20271,"This is a poor quality print of a really fun movie. Unless there is a better version out there, die-hard Jane Powell fans will have to suffer with this one.",3
A7I5J29PQTXJ0_17607,"Though the dvd is sold as high quality, the dvd image is not all that clear.  Other videos from Brazil in the same series are not this way.",2

A2LZ3CK7INRMRN_20279,This has to be the worst X Men movie up to date. What where they thinking. This movie plain and simple doesn't make sense. This movie should has been call X-Men Wolverine the Living Punching Bag.,1
A1VN0K667YNSXL_9666,One of my favorites.  Bette Midler has the best lines.  It has held up well.,4
ADBWMU6AB5I8H_22091,"Sucked - thought it would be good with such great actors, but it just sucked!  Gave up on it half way through - don't waste your money!",1
A7JAVM3JDL7BG_8719,very thoughtful story about SETI and the personal search by Jodie Foster. enjoyable. sometimes the science gets a stretch but the story holds up well.,4
A11KXXJLE2C8J2_143,"The whole story of Joseph is not well known, but this video tells it well.  The suspense of the family dynamics are very intense.  It would be nice if families today could be so forgiving.",4
A1A52X999BQXH8_8184,This a Christmas gift for my youngest cousin.  Who will be introduced to Disneyland and she cannot wait for the visit.,5
AS7T8TIQRUK2I_9705,A fun movie with lots of laughs. The things u did not like about the movie are the use of God's name as an expletive and making one character a lesbian.,4
A1JKVO2TSNV7JP_19231,What a waste of a beautiful actress (Stephanie Zimbalist). The sets look like cardboard cut-outs-the story line is weak AND the supporting cast is awful!,1
A3E9GXS75HR2CP_20535,something is wrongs to be missing a significant portion of plot between disc 1 and 2,2
A3PCNXRQZYUISC_21625,eh... if you're not a star wars fan you'll hate. If you ARE a star wars fan you probably won't love it.,3

A1P21J0DMTVGS7_4482,I had no idea this had been done back then.  It really makes you a bit suspicious of our Government in that we wonder what they are up to in this day and age!,5
AAUEX9MWA2Z7C_23498,I've never seen the world like this in a movie before. Everything you look at or touch blows up it seems.,1

AP86I2GHQDU9I_10371,"Great story, well acted, good directing. Good for children.  Most enjoyable to watch and I'm 81 years old. I would watch again.",4
A1X054KUYG5V_2357,"The Bottom Line:

Romanced all out of proportion, Monty Python and the Holy Grail has its funny and effective moments but quickly runs out of steam and creativity; many people like it but it's certainly no great movie.",3
A1E7WUXZMI4OFY_22597,Excessively and cartoonishly violent. Very surprised that actors of the caliber of Colin Firth agreed to be in this.,1
A3O5G09WB1OSVS_18916,This is a movie that is a bit corny and lower quality camera work.  It was ok to kill some time.,2

AK0D7CDKE1SZ1_20554,"Arguably Dalton was in a few decent movies and he wasn't a horrible Bond...this was just not a good movie. It was slow in many parts, disjointed in others, and broke several continuity factors within the franchise.",2

A2EVDGIGX622OG_23068,"Not one of the best Steven Seagal movies, but watchable once or twice. Anything he's made since is a lot worse.",3

A1C7BNGSZB6K2F_12625,Absolutely the worst of the Marx brothers. If you watch this the only good about it is to see a young Marilyn Monroe before see was a star. If you're a fan of the classic Marx brothers you'll be disappointed,2
A20GVWI8MT33KX_1991,I really am a big fan of Robin Williams. It is rather strange but entertaining to watch. It does have some crude seems that are rather nuts but I enjoyed watching it. I would recommend this to any Williams fan.,5

AA41C8RO9ZRC9_3625,I think this is a very funny way of looking at true love.  It shows how one must sacrifice to gain another's honest inner feelings.  It also shows how someone else's situation may not be as wonderful as it appears.,4

A34SFE9BVV8S60_11680,An OK plot with Lindsey Lohan sleuthing  a missing teacher with a nice twist to the plot. Teens finding out while adults have problems. Oh well- it's a  entertaining and fun Lark if you like that  kind of movie.,3
A1LV1W45P7OYAM_1453,Mila Jovovich is a amazing actress I love everything she is in and Resident Evil is my number film we own 2 copies of each movie and we are waiting for the next movie.,5

AA38A65DN13MO_16349,Pretty descent film considering the times but then I'm a sucker for any western film.,3
A1HQZ6ZNPIUXFX_3065,"Demi Moore did a good job acting. Striptease has everything an adult wants in entertainment. This movie was to satisfy a few simple carnal pleasures like great female nudity, and a few laughs. Not for children because of nudity.",5
A3EE0QAF0N495Q_13105,I had forgotten how funny this classic movie was.  Enjoyed it with friends on Christmas Day. Eddie Murphy and Dan Akyrod were great!,4
A22BVK7BQDBOVS_17223,"The movie kept buffering, pausing, toward the end; it took 20 min to get it to play properly.",2
A3R2A95YONZZEI_7702,The actors are excellent.  But the emergence of the first daughter is a bit over the top.  Still it's a good movie.  Would like to have known what happened to her two sons and what happened to teacher.,4

A423PNQU4SB4U_17419,Quit whining. If you don't like the this watch the special editions and close your eyes during the new parts.  There's like 2 minutes added on. Not that bug of a deal.,1
A3LAP61DFEC5CT_20927,what a disappointment o.k. i get it the movie is like 30 years old but still awful,1
A2IWMK5SLEJT5X_10330,I enjoy watching movies with dogs in it.  They are just so cute.  It was a cute story and of course the dog was the star.,4

A2ENH5GF4UK38V_3119,"Very interesting movie, especially if you enjoy British war movies. I think the English had the best movies back then, still watch whenever I get the chance.",5
A1IFJ850ISU3CJ_19417,It's a little slow and hard to follow but has some of Jack's best early work.  Especially the chicken sandwich.,3
A3PNQ1JV04ZX9S_8540,Great movie combined with a good purchase experience equals good times. I would be remiss if I didn't pass this along.,4
ALM28KEV2R56E_20807,Pretty basic and cliche would have liked to see more character development. Not a terrible watch. Probably best for 9-13 year old girls. Some sexual innuendo.,3
A1HY62B0EUBCFD_7100,"A good movie, but, too involved for children.  I watched it and decided not to give as a gift to our friend's children.",5

Gere's best performances.  Got cumbersome at the end of movie.",3

A211HO6BXMZJO1_22836,"Strangest movie I've seen in a while. If I could give it zero stars, I would. It lapses into this weird sci-fi thing half way through. Plot is ridiculous and confusing. So not worth wasting the 90 minutes.",1
AE2IPGVYEJM4Z_4523,"The movie was hysterical ....
The guys did a great job.
It takes a real actor to take on a challenge like this...
Great Job

I know that everyone would enjoy the humor in this movie",5
A3PZ6YWL0FIW9W_5494,I like this story and plot. When I was younger I always wanted a copy. A great childhood story and animation,5

A2NPZW0MXZVKPZ_13449,"I saw this movie years ago. I liked it then, and still do. However, it would never pass muster from a scientific and technical point of view.",4
A305H5ZBFM9J2H_21170,This is the first story. It may be a bit scary for little ones. They could have made the stone oracles without the gigantic (nude) breasts.  That had nothing to do with being an oracle or with a kids' movie.,3
A3F7FXBFOMJW7B_12419,Worst movie ever!  OMG.  I thought it would be great fun.  SO  SO BAD!,1
A20J989QAU0H67_15378,No digital copy.  Any movie purchased after 2010 should have a digital copy attached to it.,1
A2K1PZS7CQ9LS_12926,We watched it as a family.  My 8 and 13 year old daughters loved.  However there is several naked breast shots in the movie.  Forgot how many there were. May not be suitable for some children.,4
AAIOR5AQG00C8_21755,might be good if you have absolutely nothing else to do like watch paint dry or grass grow.,1
A3QL86H3O3NHZM_23070,"Unlike the first ""Under Siege"", this one is definitely for Seagal fans only.  He takes out a whole trainload of bad guys without breaking a sweat.  But as a fan that's why I'm watching.",3
A3ARHJHZSJIOK5_10362,I thought this was a very cute movie.  The story and inventions and Dick Van Dyke was so great!  My Granddaughter was more entertained by this than others of my older selection.,4
A1K0DIPHY379Q2_23876,"I was never fan of Quentin Tarrantino's work, so when I saw that he produced it, I had my doubts.  I lost interest after about 15 minutes.",1
A3KTHLF412OJ6M_17615,Fun movie. Great for a Friday night when you're just beat. The 80's styles are hysterical. Did we really look like that and thought we looked good!,3

A3781KNXWC29F5_22443,"We watched the pilot this past weekend, just as a ""Sunday matinee"" and it was fun!  Not great for a pilot, not bad either",3
A358R5BXBOO3ED_22336,"It is in Russian with subtitles. An interesting storyline about hardship during war in the early twentieth century, but a very primitive production by today's standards.",1

A31FZDLHGXW9WS_21837,"Another attempt to rekindle Casablanca. Unfortunately Sirocco is a very dull movie. Not terrible, just dull and tedious.",2
AIYEG9VA07EZS_13351,"Kind of stupid. But it was made in the 1960's. A remake would be much better, because the graphics would be better. Could even use many of the same actors. It's an excellent plot.",2
A1D7FV16KSF53Q_15869,This is a film i forgot about and had to see again. Its a pretty good film especially if you dig these films.,4
A3NXYUBU3KIQ9_22478,"I enjoyed the monster action, but the comedy elements felt a little out of place.

Mark Hamill is NOT the Guyver!!!!!",3
ABQR5ZDH37TFE_16628,It had an interesting storyline to it. I just found some of it had me less interested.,3
A2VJE4JXC3KIWH_17650,on a scale of one thru five. I rate the video a one-very poor. But the sound was ok,1

A3LEV4UY5GC9AU_8844,Great dark movie. If you like psychological crime movies than it doesn't get much better. Excellent film for a great price.,4
A1A26QTBBRK5EQ_651,"It was a little gloomy, but I liked it anyway.  Richard Gere is one of my favorites.",3
A29H30F3YCAXGM_9804,A good script - four stories in one movie - a lot of good actors - one of John Wayne's better non-western movies - Patricia Neal depicted a great military nurse.,4
A292U3FR3BE0FN_10185,I have always enjoyed most of Elvis's movies.  For the most part they are kind of corny but fun to watch.,4
A33QPC51A7YWIL_2766,Had to watch this film for a class. It's not bad. definitely not my favorite.,3
A1ENUDLR034VYX_20646,Disappointing. The cover and discs look like someone (not affiliated with Disney) made them. The discs also did not play.,1
A2DIS9FFG9O66Z_12150,Yes the 80s hair and clothes will amuse you but the songs and dances will get your little one smiling. And you will sing along,4

Lots of music and action.
Grandson loved it think you will too",5
A21H11NEWZSGU9_21337,This is a waste of good ski footage. It doesn't qualify as a remotely good sophomoric movie. Movie management for Amazon Prime please review your selection criteria and use this film as an example of what not to choose.,1
A1ION07KLKRK91_17032,"Disc for region 2 only, did not say so in ad. Company would not pay for return postage.",1
A157IDW7YVAOXD_13021,"Wasn't as frightful as when I watched it as a teen (duh) some, well, let's say decades ago.  Bought it because 13-yr old son wanted to watch it.  He wasn't impressed.  :)",3
A2UZ04H18IH9WT_13466,this film does not hold your attention at all.  it bogs down and you lose interest very fast--boring and weird.,2

AIHIEGASZZGLN_3664,I love Cary Grant movies. Although his acting was great in this movie...the subject matter I found rather stupid. For lack of a better description. I was glad when it was over and probably will never watch it again.,3

no pun intended
careful evaluation concludes this could have been
  a somewhat distasteful movie",2

A1NI0VOVXZBM7Y_14784,"It's a bit weird, creepy and scary at first especially when your a kid. but not a big deal. In hindsight a goofy movie and typical of it's time and the rage around the occult. although Ernest Borgnine is great.",1
A3JWMMSSM5UJ0C_4666,"I saw this in the 70s,and it's just as riveting and tense as I remember.. Despite modern international law enforcement capabilities with global communications  and computer technologies,  I enjoyed this as both historical and political storytelling. Highly recommended..",5

A3UH4ZG15VRDSJ_4558,"This was a surprisingly good movie.  Sweet, a good message and you just have to see Wesley Snipes, Patrick Swayze & John Leguizamo in drag.",5
A3R4OBLGEUYQQM_8505,I am a big Kevin Costner fan and this was a good story with humor and romance. Kevin filled the laid back character well.,4
A1SF9C9SKTJ9MQ_7053,"It's Rambo. If you grew up in the 80s you thought it was cool. Played it for my 14 year old daughter - she has an interest in what her ""Mum"" used to watch back in the day! Haha!",3

A2MO7HI2V4K5I8_1819,An unusual movie that develops beautifully throughout its length.  Lots of great scenery and suspense throughout.  If you are like most of  us you will want to see this one again to get its full impact.  Go for it!!!,5
A2F17J0JVGQS92_21928,"The movie has a very proper title - ""MAD."" You have to be mental or under acid to be able to enjoy it. Unfortunately, I am lucid and I absolutely do not do drugs.",1

A27D54VDT307BT_21279,"sort of has that million dollar baby feel about it, but nonetheless still a good movie, I liked it anyway",3
A1969SWAZMJ2E0_20243,Typical Bronson.  It is a good action film but not up to the same level as the others in the series.,3
AOYBZI9248RXA_7103,Another great movie from the past. It has to do with giving to the Lord the best you has to give.,5
ATEXEJ006UCO4_8497,"I enjoyed the movie but there are much better golf movies
around.  It was funny but i expected much more from Keven
Costner.  Most golfers will buy this DVD.",4

A1PVAW56OV0N6L_4520,This is for my collection for when I go cable free soon...I can't wait to go cable free I like to choose what I watch and when I watch and I love the pause.,5
A2YLKQJOGJ8R85_15946,Still a great movie but it is so long that I can only give it 4 stars. It is easy to loose interest after two hours,4
A2K53OYO4JJO28_2894,A suspense story with a lot of interesting stories that make up the larger one. Unfortunately this film was overlooked by both the critics and public. Kathy Bates delivers a great performance. When doesn't she?,4
A19MEFCUKUGOFB_15148,One of the longest movies I have ever had to watch for a research paper.  It isn't fully historically correct so it was a disappointment.,2
A30ABQ77NSQ143_14761,The film looks fantastic. The movie itself is just fair. An old fashion musical that was old fashion when it was released. Streisand's singing is great but she seems to be playing Mae West.,3
A3GCZR20IHBPRX_22464,"I receive this and it was to be a action night for the boys, but this will not play on my blu-ray, the disc state that its not for my region? Say what.",2
AKBUEB0XZUODC_3177,This film was very well done. However I prefer Cary Grant in his more comical films. It was a well done film though.,4
A1HG1FMPUS8IHL_6923,Another great Christian Bale performance.  He was really psycho.  I watched this movie and was impressed with his early acting.  He's an awesome actor.  A must buy for fans.,5

A3EEQ7TL9EP077_12129,"They got quite a few very good actors into this turkey, but it still could not fly. Some of Plummer's and Mason's worst work.",3
A2O88HFN90MISY_805,This is an all time classic movie from the 60's and early 70's eras. Really nice bikes shown in this movie!,4
A31X9O49RQUNZ1_17748,"A good movie, which would have been even a lot better if it had a more appropriate and suspenseful musical score.",3
A15M05B0Z6GYG2_19903,Good movie not the beat of the x-men movies i have to admit but still a good one,3
A3RA09USCPG73Z_18412,This is a fun movie.  Caught it on HBO. If you like breaking out of prison movies with some twist and turns; this one does it for you.  Joan Chen as the two timing bitch girlfriend is fun to watch.,3
AW3QSEHVDBIPQ_16990,I bought this for a friend and have not yet had the opportunity to watch it. We were both please at the speed and condition (new) it came in though.,3
A22JOZQ89H60TA_870,"This movie will make you laugh a great many times, and it may even make you cry a time or two. The casting was great and these awesome performers definitely deliver performances to be proud of.",5
AGTW3D6HRM08Y_18564,"Everything  was fine except the aspect ratio of the picture, but that is not amazon's fault, that is the shortsightedness of the Disney Corporation.",3

A1QNR2QJCNA19_11669,"I liked it, but  I think most people would find it to slow.  You really have to like Hardy",4
A25GOTH9Z2E8KC_12390,I didn't like this movie.  Way too bloody and no real ending to the movie. The story line was confusing and a bit creepy.,1
A1EMFL1NXN4R1Q_15198,Enjoyed the movie with the family.  Very family friendly and some great actors from a bygone era.  Good for history buffs :),4
A1Q56VEKL6EUHS_22653,"Very poorly acted. I wouldn't call this a B movie, more like a D- movie.",2
A3BOV0S5JRADGE_3474,great movie he just got out of jail was in Vegas on the radio GOOD luck Jorge.,5
A1JMPUPX3J3603_20411,"We had to send this back due to objectionable language mostly. It certainly like the Poirot we bought was a far cry from what was shown on PBS. The Rutherford version is much better, and follows the text more closely.",1
A206JYZTUXTFAS_22286,"The bloom has gone off of Jeff Goldbloom, if in fact there ever was one.  Never cared much for him before, but after seeing Hideaway and Beyond Suspicion both in a single night I`ve seen enough.",3
A2ONRB4OL1I5WH_1377,"A classic!  A great movie to watch on Halloween night!  It has that small town setting, mixed with the 80s wonderfulness... it's fantastic!",5
A2GPLOLLE6BUDT_22989,"Bad acting, bad script.  Bad movie.  I hope I can forget having watched this mess.  Certainly belongs on anyone's list of top ten worst films.",1
A1P3BZ61K6F8HW_21452,Very slow moving story...not very enticing...sound quality not great.  We did not finish this movie as it did not hold our interest.  Unusual experience at best.,1
A137QY3DH2ETBK_18161,"movie in spite of good actors in it, sucked. donated it to public library as boring action flick for them to shelve or sell at garage sale.",1
A1FVCUJRJRA020_5766,"Had to restart a few times, it would freeze up and it would buffer.  Finally got through it.  Great movie!",3
A2S8PRMFPKQGM1_7416,"Love this movie!!  Had my kids watch a good ole classic.  My kids really enjoyed watching the movie.  Thanks, thanks!!",5
A2380XP8EJTZI6_23485,Its a fun film the storyline is very similar to pillow talk in my book,3
AUOFXK54JKVFA_10844,"This DVD has excellent sound and picture quality.  For a movie that was made in the late 30's, it has been well preserved.  Any DVD I order from Amazon has excellent quality.",4
A2AM6777NZDSTB_19590,"Good in theory but bad in publication. As a side note, she kisses a man who previously yelled violently at her? Not a good model for young girls in choosing men.",1
A3MHEGH6EIS5ZU_468,"A wonderful series great for a rainy weekend cozied up with cups of tea and occasional sherry. Marvelous cast, wonderful story and lovely nostalgia if you saw the original.",5
A1JGAT75KL6OYY_18727,"It was just plain bad, but the 4 and 6 year olds that were visiting enjoyed it.  That should be your guide",1
A3HIUJ0AQT9SRC_3064,"Hot, hot, hot. I've never seen Demi Moore hotter...and I like the story, too...written by Carl Hiaasen of the Miami Herald...I'm a south Floridian and love his books...adding a mostly nude Demi Moore is total gravy...",5
A28K0C3GFZHJ9X_7550,A really enjoyable movie that is... *gulp* twenty seven years old at this point. One thing I noticed in the credits for the first time is that Richard Gere both composed and played the piano solo in the bar. Wow.,4
A3QHJUHTBJMFYZ_271,"This DVD is a GREAT resource! It offers women the opportunity to really DO something for their pelvic floor! As both a midwife and a woman with a pelvic floor injury, I highly recommend this DVD.",5
A1Y9UDIK7CHNLB_19861,"A little 'over the top'  :-)
But a decent movie.  Amazing how John Lithgow can be such a sadistic actor in this movie while being such a funny man in '3rd Rock' . . . .  A lot of over-acting!!!!!",3
ALZ9AA32637NM_1805,I have never seen this at 47 years old. My 4.5 year old loves it and so did I.,4
A2O51OL56OJONR_21558,It apparently is an old VHS tape and the audio is not good.  But the movie itself is  very excellent.,3
AHZWYFV9D0QAQ_7552,but it's got a good message and it kept the feeling of the first one.  I love bad little monsters.,4
A3CL5UNBASAAPC_2413,Decent movie with some interesting family dynamics and social dilemmas. Futuristic conventions were lacking when compared with current CGI capabilities in movie production.,3
AAOR4P9TMI02W_1672,THIS MOVIE WASNT WAHT I HAD THOUGHT. ITS ALL THE WRONG THING. U THINK THAT THIS IS going to HAPPEN AND SOMETHING ELSE HAPPEN. IF I WAS U THEN I WOULDNT GO AND SEE IT.,2
A1T9H027NB787N_10623,A Jarmusch classic. Who can forget the bemused Japanese tourists at Sun Studios? It has not dated quite as well as I hoped but it worth watching for performances by Steve Buscemi and Screaming' Jay Hawkins.,4
A2CDCYANNAVXF2_16715,I did not find this funny.  Maybe I watched it for 10 minutes before I had to quit.,1
AFU8Q0K8UR1Z4_19929,I remember this film coming out when ! was 10 years old.  Finally I got to see it. An OK film but the ending is just tacked on after all the hoopla. What a disappointment!,3

A157YJT5WFLYJX_17450,"I've seen much better versions.  This is dull, irritating in its use of inferior techniques, and uninteresting.  Too bad, for Wind in the Willows is a marvelous classic, and deserved better.",2
A36I012JJTZUZ_1124,The Theatre sound was way too loud but I liked the idea of this movie and it's connection t5o other movies. A great Super Hero Comedy. I think Arnold has some spunk left in him yet!,4
ADA37023QOO8R_13119,"Great to see Eddie and Dan when they were thin. The movie was alright, now I see some of the lines as not too cool...",3
A1XVY7QFMOFD3V_14804,A bit dated but it is a classic.  The cast and acting is better than most movies.  Shelly Winters gets to show off a little bit of her swimming ability.,4
AYVCSOJ4VKAJR_3326,thanks . for the prompt service and the movie is great just what i expected . i got quick .,5
A2GJDLBFDTA5GP_12182,"One of the worst movies I've ever endured.  Ridiculous plot, poor writing, bad acting.  Need I say anything else?  The best thing about this film is the London fog.",1
A2LIACN9V1XZBU_22158,"This was my first PRIME movie, I just watched it to see how the system worked.  The Prime Free Movie thing was great, but the movie left something to be desired.",2
A2490GBIRZVVJT_7412,Wonderful modern classic! Good romance and great movie about elderly retired couple and their problems with younger generations. Enjoyed these movies!!!,5

A3AP6RTVV0EHI8_5957,This movie is a total waste of time.  It is the worst movie I have ever endured.  I kept watching to the end thinking that there must be something more.  But there was never anything more.  Just terrible!!,1
ANUA3DP8WT3N4_16421,"Had a couple of black out spots, but only for a moment.  Otherwise very good film to watch.  Had never seen it before. It was recommended to us by a Doctor friend.",4
A1OHY5WNQSCPNH_21194,"More of a ""lifetime movie"" then a box office hit. Good acting and great plot by both actors though. Worth a watch",3
A2Z89S52358TU6_16461,The acting was terrible. I didn't expect an Oscar winning performance but I expected better than I got. Melanie Griffith never has been a great actor but she's been better.,3
A2UXMWJIWV3AZ8_8265,"Bob Hoskins is awesome in this neat combination of live actors and animation! Fun, witty and a bit of inuendo makes this a great adult comedy. Younger folks will not get the hidden messages. Worth every penny!",5
A1G716OJDGPKZH_2523,DVD was received in a timely manner.  This is one of my favorite films from the 80's.  A great cast from Roy Schneider to the great Warren Oates.,4
AU1L04KUPXPJF_13939,I usually stay away from movies made before 1970 but this was one I had to see as Jerry Lewis is liked by a lot of people.,4

ASAR1V7IO0HC8_5108,"I never tire of viewing this classic, and I watch it at least once a year, if not more often.",5
A3BP8TWTIMD3MZ_23217,This movie was rather disappointing. Great names from radio days often have great difficulty working in the movies. That's especially true here.,2
A1BFBADPMU97C1_22659,Probably seen this one about 5 or 6 times. Typical 007 campy fare... it's ok.,3
ANGFDOSY7R38L_16823,"nonetheless delightful slapstick comedy.  One episode was enough to refresh my memory, however.  I really don't think it's necessary to write further words on the subject.",4

A22JV9RAPT6R4I_19146,It was typical black and white movie noir. If you like and black and white movies then you probably will enjoy this.,3
A2SJVJ42LU9FYC_18317,"This film has actors that  portrait well but their actions are weak.  It could have been much better, but its a flesh film at best.  If Ray is built like a hulk then use those abilities outside of  body shots.",3
A2E2XIV5H964IK_11911,BAD. BAD. BAD. What the hell was the moped scene all about? The first one was a lot better. Watch that one and forget about this useless piece of  ^#$%.,2

A great classic.",5
A2TDOIVC16QLII_17678,"The only thing good about the movie is the dancing. Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, and Ann Miller. They are 3 of the best dancers and you won't see anything like this again.",3
A5E1V08A5AN6_17752,"If this is not the most disagreeable movie experience ever, it certainly ranks with the top three, and stands alone as the single worst viewing experience.  The story almost saved itself before the horrible ending.",1
A191C8FL8D9VVT_17195,"If you are yearning for Marie Osmond, ok.  I didn't finish it, as it was unbearably trite, bad costumes, and mediocre acting.",2

A1N0H85T058RMI_14527,"How young they both were! Talking about the actors and the real life people. Such a short life for them, and most of it none of their doing. Great performances and such a sad story.",4
AUYOSNKVHJAD6_1356,Well worth the price. The documentary alone is well worth the price. Just don't see a better quality edition coming out. Fans of this cult classic will want this in their collection.,5

A2Y8251P67CZTH_8644,I don't like Tom Curise but he was good in this movie. It was close to the book but of course they did change it a little. This movie has good acting and keeps you wanting to watch more.,4

A1W1QOZBJQL1SR_14840,A low key sci-fi. Average plot and not much action. Pretty good for an older movie. My daughter loves Farrah Fawcett movies.,4
A1X5G1YZBI5SVA_10948,"This movie is by my estimation been over rated. Acting is good, scenery good, story line is slow, and boring.

A2BAHTNDX4RJ4L_11853,I would not recommend this movie to anyone.  Terrible audio and video.  Looks and sounds as if it was made in the 1930's or 1940's.  Turned it off after only minutes.,1

A13JU88JAHN72I_20564,Its ok...wasn't what i thought it would by. Its mostly about how the cartoons are created and put together by the animators.,3

A272RIGQ5ILO66_14550,I am a Bruce Lee fan and the last scene of Bruce fighting with Chuck Norris is really exciting.  Recommended.,4
A2318JDGHUVP2B_9898,This has a good story line though some parts unrealistic. It does strike a tone for the NRA and why traveling  with a gun makes sense. I think this may be even more believable more now than in past years.,4
A1W9ZSVV0IYKFW_526,This could have been a 4 star movie but there are parts that are just pathetic and they are relatively frequent.,3
A342RRPTB87ZK2_12187,"The series as I recall it, was really good, it has been a long time, and I remember the series as a child, when it came out, in the 1980's.",4

A34RW2KH2ZQSNT_2554,Thank you so very much for this great movie; I love it!  I will be sharing it with my friends.,5
A2OV6SUOKR3OE3_1822,I like this movie because there is enough action in it and shows how Kevin Costner is so peaceful in finding himself and living off the land.,5

A3S3F5K301VUFR_6742,A decent movie. Not great. Certainly not a waste of time. Steve Martin is always funny. Good story and entertaining,3

A17WQ7V915BMKO_2591,This movie is well made in every respect.  It is beautiful.  You could shut the sound off and still have enough to be seduced by.  Martin Scorcese hit it out of the park on this one.,5

AOGJR2WKKETT2_16252,I didn't much care for the movie.  This was no reflection on Barabara Stanwyck's acting or the director... they held it together.  It was just a poorly written script.,2
A28SFSEY00JMCW_14172,"Terrible film. Horrible casting, horrible writing, and most of all horrible direction. Kenneth Branagh should stick to theatre because he is absolutely horrible with cinema.",1

ACO20QL72D1E6_6958,"The plot is a funny pastische and the entire cast and crew excel. Yup, Hitchcock may have been old, but the old master roared his last contribution to the world of cinema. It remains both hilariously funny and exciting:-)",5

A35GGP0VUXMF1B_22065,I was more confused than anything.  But that is probably because I watched this super late in the night and was half asleep.  Lol.  Great cast however and very well written.  No wonder it won so many awards!,3
AG74WADVVCCKD_2283,What more can I say. It's Monty Python and it's funny. What makes it even funnier is the people doing the acting don't seem to recognize how off the wall they are being. It's gut wrenching funny.,5

A2XXSN5GZPPL87_8985,Good quality definition but since it takes place in a number of rainy/dark environments the HDR feature wasn't noticeable.  No worth the price of over $30.00 in my opinion,3
A3NO6R2M9H0W6A_1352,Just received this. Case is cheaply made but that's not my concern. The blu-ray transfer looks fantastic on my 4k tv. It plays perfectly on my PS4 if anyone had questions about that. Very happy,5

A2C21DQ4FQARGV_19672,This movie is boring. Every time I try to watch this movie I get the same result: boring. I don't know what other reviewers see that gave it 5 stars; because this movie is awful. From beginning to end completely dreadful.,1

In addition who can beat the acting of Cary Grant?
Great classic film!",4
A3L9FS7GNCV9CD_4830,this movie is great once you get past the beginning.  there is quite a bit of what i would call raunchy behavior by the two characters - so I will just have to fast forward through it,4

A3R2W6NBUIIXWM_321,Fascinating film diverging from most war flicks in its presentation of the protagonists and their eventual grudging accommodation to their circumstances. Withheld a fifth star as I didn't like the ending.,4
A1DFI9XU2SCP5L_7724,It made Julia Roberts!  The fairy tale that is too good to be true comes alive here in beautiful settings and costumes and with enough tongue in cheek to make it enjoyable,5

A2P4EQSBZNJRUW_23140,OK WW2 war film produced during the war. Typical Hollywood touches for that era. Nothing special but I stayed interested enough to watch it all the way through...,3
A36V31817AD0BU_9313,"It's a classic, great actors, great plot. Hitchcock never fails. Nary an expletive uttered - that sounds old-fogeyish but good directors don't require that.",4
A3E6PN9V6XJVC5_11801,Out of the whole show maybe 5-10 minutes was worth watching.  Not really all that funny and the use of foul language was not always necessary.,3

A3IJTFOJO1OW0Y_15029,"Fine acting by Redford and Dunaway and good direction in this CIA thriller.  Redford's character, however, is much too macho, more like a field agent than a man who makes his living by reading books and magazines.",4

A1VYBJ22W1Z4JF_21142,Was entertaining I guess. The plot was ok the acting was horrible the story was a 4 star and the ending is unbelievable and was way far fetched. The human brain can not work without blood period.,3

A25H0V36Q49Q6E_13787,Very funny satire.  Too bad Charles Grodin is in it. Met him before. Not a pleasant person. kind of ruins the movie for me. The fact that his character's life is destroyed helped.,4

A60RC6PSE9F25_1297,Taxi Driver is the definitive cinematic portrait of loneliness and alienation manifested as violence. It is as if director Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader had tapped into precisely the same source of psychological inspiration,5

Similar idea to the 6th sense movie",5

A3RTG4U54DIKJQ_18739,Story ping pongs back and forth with standard action. Once again if Charlton Heston was not in this you could not watch it with any credibility.,3

A3BZ2SXZOI6C8G_8638,"Present for mom. Why she likes this movie, i have no idea. Could be mostly for Matthew McConaughey. I have seen it once, it was ok. The idea of the plot was executed alright. Just not my cup of tea.",4

ABVYGB2TKBO8F_6466,I watch a lot of movies. This is the only movie I ever paid to watch at a theater and walked out in the middle of it. I saw no redeeming value in the movie and found it unrealistic.,1
A2CRPHPW2YCLP0_4956,"Dave Chappelle is hilarious on so many levels, as well as his costars. This movie is consistently funny all the way through. It's easy to see why people pull references from this classic everyday. Love it!",5

A3FWJFPC486L99_10152,I wanted to see the original again after the remake got panned.  Holds up pretty well considering the state of special effects when this was made.  Still some scary spots and some nice comic relief.,4
AVN7046HZM2NP_23259,Ugh. Not my favorite cult classic but there are some redeeming moments. Much rolling of the eyes and exasperated sighing. Watch if you have time to kill on a sick day maybe?,3
A15SA13U1NTWY1_17327,I was looking for a movie for my kid that wasn't your normal Disney formula show. She liked it and watched most of the movie. (She is 2 so she doesn't make it all the way through much.,3

A2FBPS1P12N24T_15975,Two good actors Ernest Borgnine and Herbert Lom - both well into their declining years.  Terrible movie,1

A3NO6R2M9H0W6A_8096,I bought this used so i wasn't expecting perfection. blu-ray disc is completely unscratched but there are some tears in the binding. Not too noticeable so I'm pleased considering the low cost on a Disney classic,4

AOSJ0ARQRFN0K_16354,Even Charlton Heston and Jack Palance couldn't overcome this poorly written script. Mr. Heston has always been one of my favorite romantic leads but no fervor here. The characters didn't go beyond 2 dimensional in any way. Bad script!!,1

A2N69401B7WTLW_15884,I felt a need to see this movie again after returning from a cross country trip wherein my luggage was lost by the airlines going AND returning.  It's a light hearted comedy with some therapeutic values.,4
A3K0E9JKGAHI5T_9398,"I like PT Boats, and this film does not disappoint. It's a mixture of war, action, and some light romance. I think this movie shows just how PT boats were used, and how dangerous the work was.",4
A38PQR2I7COAR5_894,Steel Magnolias is the old south no longer there. These women were typical southern belles who love each other and bond as a community. This is a great movie for families but PG,4
A2YZA6TIT0QDCP_9560,A rather unsettling movie for me. Too much of the supernatural stuff. Charlize Theron was worth the price of admission.,3
A3QWQFU4ASTAYN_22898,I did not like the way the story was done & didn't like the way the characters were portrayed; it was like the were in a bad situation comedy from the 1970's.,2

AIRKVUWUY21F4_5488,My son is learning about Egypt in school and this show illustrates all the things he needed to remember. It reinforced what he was learning and they now watch it again and again. Just because they like it. Michelle,5

A1110E06W6VWO3_17724,"Very slick and sophisticated, but with absolutely no feeling or depth. Harvey is appropriately  slick and insincere, Taylor comes off as a shrill harridan, and Merrill resembles a mannequin. Some of the dialogue is  ludicrous even for 1960.",2

A35HGQBLSG7XRJ_11213,But I like B Films.  It's a good way to waste some time.  Have some friends over and say rude things about it.,4
A20IXLDYYIYGNZ_14265,"They learn to open their eyes and stand by their convictions, it's called ""coming of age"". I like this movie a lot.",3
A3GOVAE98P9S5T_14127,"Awesome actors - wanted to ""strangle"" the mother at times, so apparently they did what they set out to do - show how people handle situations in different ways.",4
ANR1HAH23WSYX_6823,"It has not aged well and does not come close to the book.  That said, if you want a flashback to the 80's/90's with a dark twist it is work the view.  Read the book first.",3
A2O4SQP6ZN7QTD_23065,This is a good action movie but there are to  many unbelievable actions that could not possibly be done in the moving train at high speeds.,3
A3EFN02SD0DX5I_2164,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES BRONSON MADE AND I NEVER GET TIRED OF WATCHING IT.,5
A181XRGXAO6COB_12576,"Shirley MacLaine was so cute and fresh in her early days. A lot of talent there.
This movie probably wowed them in theaters but now we can anticipate every move.
It's worth watching if you're a vintage movie fan.",3
A1LQAWK5QXGS4L_15806,"Seen years before, knew my grandchild would get a kick out of the little girl and the babysitting fun. Cheesy, but a classic in the way of Real Genius.",4

A1U35P9YXF3QM9_20697,Not the best work any of the actors have done and didn't appreciate the F-bomb. Threw the movie away.,2
AYF0FYBTRGDWR_13547,A favorite of mine.  Bought as a gift for young adult grandchild.  He loved it.  Being passed on to his sister.,4
A1W5E0LBOBI8P0_20824,Not the best movie. Very slow. May be good for a 12 year old for whom it was probably intended,1
A2G7J3P4EVUH8U_20158,I didn't like it.  'Invaders from Mars' is a better movie. 'War of the Worlds' is also a better movie. I like cheesy outer space movies from the past. Some are better than others.,2
AB02E1GU39AGI_17457,The pacing was extremely slow but the story was good. It's worth a watch some rainy night when nothing's on tv.,3
A27M6TBYGNNY37_21719,"good acting, an interesting plot included a partially nude scene between two women which probably was unnecessary -  but they were attractive women.",3

A3617MUVB2ACOQ_9249,"Well, it am not no terminator but there is pretty good special effects and good action.  Kurt says maybe 50 words throughout the whole movie but he certainly did bulk up for the role.  Worth renting.",3
A3OEKEAZ08OQRB_5596,Great action and fighting by Jason Scott Lee. Not a very accurate rendition of his story but still fun to watch.,4
A1RN47J09VYYIY_15113,The  battle of the bulge happened in winter of 1944 with lots people freezing to death so why does the movie show the battle of the bulge happened in the summer in Italy?,1
A2SVHQ6PVOA7S6_21796,Generally fun. Some good lines.  Matthau makes a great Einstein but it's difficult to swallow Meg Ryan as a brainiac,3
A362Z612DXNUY7_11516,"I can sum this all up in one statement: Don't even go there! This film, with no insults to Jennifer Aniston or Warwick Davis (Both two of my favorite actors), stinks (in my opinion)!!!",1

A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A_23059,"With little or no campy acting to hang your attention on or even a great score like the first, this movie becomes just a boring almost coma inducing attempt at horror. Really the PITS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1

AFQDSFS37C7XK_10824,So much time waiting... so much money invested... and they only give us a Spanish dub version??? And just the NEW version? That sucks. Spanish subtitles are a MUST!,3

A2B1KCDHHB1TIX_14928,"Overall this movie supplied many laughs. John Candy and Rip Torn were great.  Richard Crenna plays the ""villain"" role well in this summer comedy.  Definitely a good one.  Recommend it.",4
A3M56EW84GPMUB_3187,"Sets/scenery - awesome.

Plot - first rate.

Direction - Hitchcock (says it all).

AD0HF7KPJ64AD_20321,"Still a great spectacle of animation, but the dubbed voices are lethargic and don't accentuate Yuji Moriama's story like the original Japanese does. But if you don't like subtitles, you would probably miss the point of A-Ko  anyway....",3
A33AQN7PV1ONEW_12842,Too many sight gags and no substance. Even good comedy needs substance. Excessive stupidity gives me a headache.,1
A1R5X05L8BSZRJ_17923,"Worth watching, but the effects don't hold up very well and the plot premise is a little strained.  The video quality was just fine, though.",3

A3QMRSCI8WVHD_22442,"Insipid writing, wooden acting, silly plot. I couldn't watch it for even a half hour. The old Clutch Cargo cartoons were far better.",1
A1AG7KGTR6M40G_22860,Stopped watching after about 5-10 minutes because of very vulgar language.  I thought it might get better after a few minutes but it got worse.  I quit at the beginning of the line-up scene.,1

A110S1R6C7UEJ8_5612,"This film is an inspiring biopic of Lee's life. I consider this film atonement for the fiasco film ""Game of Death"" that is Lee's final film. Jason Scott Lee's performance channels Lee's spirit - it is that good.",5
A1Q3WWMDLUNYS6_8022,"The Original and still one of the best! For those of us who grew up with them this is the point where they broke through to the big screen.
*MUPPET ARM FLAIL!*",5
A3P7WNM0UHV4YQ_18796,I didn't like this that much - parts are ok but in general it's too slow and something about it I don't like - so fast forwarded after 10 minutes and got done with it quickly.,1
A12TYI6HZOUT0U_4638,Good movie. But the story about the Spanish and the Africans running the slave trade was glossed over.,4

A3LY5TF3LOBLXZ_3354,"The John Ford trilogy is something to see.  However, this is an ""extended play"" version.  Be prepared to see the navy blue uniforms as kelly green.  Such is the distortion of ""EP"".  Great  price.",1
A2NBQ9E181AC8O_16844,Some things do not make sense.  1st movie in the series was the only good one.  You can verify that by the sales.,2

AXB3M1W0Q8MMD_6571,Awesome movie. I remember seen it when it first came out. But its better on blu-ray,5
A1FSA31PO4KPO2_19786,Good Agatha Christie plot - British actors were wonderful - but all the American stars were not so great.  The TV productions of Christie's books are much better.,3
A1KP0IVWU0RQ0A_17710,"Oh man this is really one of the worst of the 80's ""slasher"" movies. Tom Hanks shows up for a minute, but the last almost 90. SKIP IT",1
A184II7EKOPEWL_10228,If you don't like sad stories about oppression don't watch this. I expected it to be more about the musician himself.,2
A1TMWJUC1AMGQI_736,Oh I love this movie. I loved the friend dynamics and what it meant to be a friend. Funny that no one had cell phones and life seemed so much less hectic.,4

A30X0KYJZOUA5H_17058,"When I put in my DVD player it wouldn't play. Because of the ""reliable"" source in England, they do not have the same type of equipment as we do here in the States, it could not play. SO VERY DISAPPOINTED",1

AIR64T7C5ZP6W_15052,"Suspenseful, but dated.  Still a good movie for a date night or late-night-cant'-sleep-night.  Robert Redford is almost always good, except when he talks politics.",4
A1LF5TAF3P7UNO_1197,Loved this movie when I first saw it. I enjoyed revisiting it. I like the biblical references that make you really think about how you are living your life. I love the message of hope in the ending.,4

AVNVBCEAEW0YT_16913,"This is not remotely 'Animal House' level.  This is trash.  Why?  Because it pushes so hard with nothing to push for.  For sure, every actor gave his or her ""all"" in this rotten film.",1

A2QZGNPHWBMM6E_5734,i liked this but u should not require a narrative if you r using a star system.  it will prevent me from rating in the future because of time,5

AVTQB8FI2KW8Q_19210,"This show tries, with music and mysterious narration,  to make more of things than they are.  There is also a tremendous amount of repetition, as in what's coming up next.  During episodes and regarding future episodes.  I found it tedious.",2
AP9U6DGEG4O33_2795,Great movie. Actually could be rated as fact.( just insert a few of our White House Politician names in place of the actors.,5
A6TH3RKT4F61T_11892,It was ok i got a little bored of course i had read the book first so sometimes i guess that happens.,3
A1FMHHJI1LAEGE_18241,Couldn't give it a one star rating because of a couple of cute scenes that rescue it from the absolute bottom of the barrel... that said it's still a bad movie.,2

AV1S53AGJEEF4_19850,A great story and a well-made film. Very heavy drama. Not for the squeamish.  A window into Chinese culture and traditions.,3
ASEHXBNIQU49P_14866,Great Movie!!! But not one of John Candy's funniest. In my own opinion John Candy's funniest movie would be either  THE GREAT OUTDOORS or UNCLE BUCK.,4

A3RBHXGEWW869Z_816,"This was a ""movie night"" special from my dad. Definitely not a let down. It's nice watching older movies, sometimes, because the style is so much different than what we get nowadays.",5
A1LF84ED2L4MXB_14774,Why doesn't Gregory Peck just TELL his wife the child isn't hers? That would clear everything up. The suspense of the movie is built on the absurd fact that he never tells her.,4
A1XT2USG1HVDM4_10599,"Giving C.H.O.M.P.S. a 4 star rating (even though it's technology is quite outdated), because my kids all laughed like crazy! This was a clean, innocent, fun movie and we wish there were many more like this for families to enjoy.",4
A1BQS99326L8WZ_21223,"A few laughs here and there. It's one of those movies that you probably won't watch over and over again, but it was a pretty funny. It's worth watching just for Lou Ferrigno choking out Andy Dick if nothing else.",3

actors of all time. .a great addition for Mr. Fonda's fans.",3

I guess it's clearly outdated, somewhat zany",3

A34OD5GD02R6KN_16912,Nice to see how different cultures and military attitudes play out again each other.  In this case - the US surface ship against a German U-boat of WWII.,3

A1GNM2AIQPG2M4_1286,Some humor but doesn't warrant 4.5 stars. Basically a bunch of dorks without much plot.,3

A3P86KQ4D2OI2S_17624,The movie is entertaining with Chuck Norris martial arts but based on a false assumption that there were gambling casinos in the crown colony. Actually one had to go to Macao to find a casino.,3

A27R8L3OANP8R6_18151,This title was never released on DVD by the company that owns the rights to it.  'Import all regions' should be a tipoff that it's a rip-off.  Buy the higher quality VHS real thing.,2

A1S1MNQM8DEGD5_9181,"I did not order Italian version.  I do NOT speak Italian so would not knowingly ever order a movie I cannot understand!! What is to be done about this situation?

A2DAR704KDA4OF_7739,"It doesn't matter how many times you have seen it, this movie never disappoints.  Not for children under 13 though!",5
A1J0Y8FJVA2V21_9906,"Robert Duvall nearly saves the movie, but there's just too much estrogen and too much affirmative action.  This ""thriller"" is just too tedious with the MSNBC bimbo, and the effeminate kid (Elijah Wood) and HIS bimbo.  It could've been good.",1
A35U3QBAN21005_11645,It was a reasonable way to spend 90 minutes. The acting was a bit wooden and the special effects budget must have been really low but so be it.,3
A7Z0BH7O3ONMM_11531,Used to be a favorite movie as a child. Have to raise the tv volume loud to hear it. The quality is not as good as the VHS copy I used to own,3

A2LKXDUWPIZW5D_10930,"Very slow for me, but that's kind of how Ang Lee rolls.  Not my favorite adaptation; I find the BBC-funded ones to be much more engaging.",3
ABVXBZTXRV45S_9991,This is the last movie I went to see more than three times in a theater. Delighted to have it on blu-ray. Only down side is there are no noteworthy extras with this solo package.,4
A243GUOTNUF2VN_21065,"If you are a fan of this film buy it by all means! The colorized and black-and-white prints are great and worth the price. The special features are repetitive though, using much of the same material over and over again.",3

A247QAAGM1O82_6108,Love the movie but OMG that intro song SHE by Elvis Costello was the absolute most annoying and awful song I've ever heard. Fast forward and it's a very good rom com,4

A2Z1QHZO13M7L3_17418,I'll keep this short. Stick with the DVD of this film. Blu-ray did away with the original soundtrack in the film and cut some scenes down or out completely. In this case DVD rules over the blu-ray!!!,1
A2UXJ3XRNXM29C_20117,"That pretty much sums it up.  Best Batman TAS story.  Great animation, acting, voices, sound effects, and kick ass soundtrack!",3

A1DRIDS21O2NYY_9584,"Cheap horror flick fodder. Pacino as the devil is the only good (excellent) part. Reeves is predictable in just about every case, and I can see the thin spots in his acting.",2

A39K4Y985EGPC7_6576,A classic. Must see. I hadn't seen it until 2015. Pretty timeless movie. Only unrealistic part is that no guy would have ever said no to the hottie. Other than that I loved it.,5

A3K33N27Y3V47M_12340,Errol Flynn was born in 1909 and died in 1959 which means he was about 48 years old when he made this movie. He was not in his 50's as you so stated.,4

A2QPFTG2KRNZKA_19096,"I had never seen this movie and thought I'd give it a go.  It's a campy show and certainly pushed the envelope of outrageousness when it first aired in the theaters years ago, but it didn't hold my interest.",3
