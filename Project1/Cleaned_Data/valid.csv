AK67ALTOL1GCY_11459,This movie has interesting meanings beyond sex. It gives a valuable lesson on erotica. The show was well done if you look beyond the sex to the deeper meaning.,4
A2OOQ59V7YWYL1_21102,Bought the DVD and got a free Instant Video with the purchase.  When I access the page it says I have to pay for it.  I can't find any help on this problem. So much for FREE.,1

AWA3LPBQ1AAEG_793,This is not a legit Blu Ray release. The picture and sound quality are both very poor. I should have done my research. It seriously looks like some one burned the DVD to a Blu-ray. VERY DISAPPOINTED.,1
AV5L5PNOS9R2K_21304,"The ending could use a rewrite, plus Brooks  made his character look more psychotic than Brendan Fraser's.",3
A1YFKAYR825YAC_10509,This is a movie I remember seeing about 50 years ago.  It is well done.  The music and story telling are great.  Probably best left to children.  The plot is rather thin.,3

A2L3Y17SPNJ918_9,This movie is better than it ought to be. Authentic settings and costuming for America 1930's Depression Era. The Scrooge character really does a good changeover. In old TV 4:5 ratio.,4
A38S169G91IWXV_23343,This has some cute twists of Eddie Murphy adaptation of Dracula to a black culture. Not an award winner but a fun and entertaining movie.,3

A1TA5QYECZP1L1_19571,This is a lightweight horror-mystery hybrid from 1974. The audio is not quite synced up but this film has some entertainment value. Calvin Lockhart is interesting as the reclusive big game hunter billionaire. Gotta love the 70's vibe.,3

A3ECDS5FZ2E4W3_22108,"As in the new edition of Lawrence of Arabia, there is something drastically wrong with the sound recording.  While most voices are excellent, Peter O'Toole's voice is barely audible.  It means constantly adjusting the volume on your remote.",3
A2A1AJO2GNTG6W_19938,It is obvious that Mr. O'Toole needed a pay check in order to appear in this schlock. What a waste of a great acting talent.,1
AMF9EZ9ZP610V_2834,Great old movie with three great stars.  Very pleased with this selection.  Very lighthearted theme with a predictable ending--my kind of movie.....,5
A1UPP9DBWCGD78_9874,Poorly written. I had to stop half way through. It was unrealistic everyone celebrating the coming of a comet that will destroy the earth. Jokes were cheesy.,2
A2B8943E6Y9TIU_9497,Sandra Dee was a hugely popular star in the 60's and this movie has campy appeal.....beautiful people in all kinds of romantic tangles. Unforgettable music and a great gift for any baby boomers on your list!,4
A2F6NAXP03S9FV_3477,Great shipping package and arrived promptly. As for the story-line goes its epic. I defiantly recommend this to people who rate this 4 and 5 stars.,4

A3BYBJAYZIA80_2072,"Can't beat Rumpole of the Bailey; however, the range of accents and Rumpole's mumbled asides makes the dialog sometimes hard to hear/understand without closed captioning or subtitles.  Otherwise, as excellent as it was years ago on television.",4

A3MRWCBCHN31A7_5832,"Lots of true things...not just one.  Great portrait of how easily we deceive ourselves every day, about everything, and how and why.  And, what happens if and when the veil is removed.  Well-acted and believable real family.",4

A1I6FXZTS61MJ_778,Glorious cast and eternal story.  I watch this movie every few years and it never disappoints.  They just don't make movies or actors like this anymore,5

A30VTD6ZB8GMBE_19697,Typical Mel brooks silly humor. Gets old quickly. Like most of Mel brooks work it relies upon exaggeration and absurdness to pull chuckles. If that is amusing to you then you may love it.,3

A2NRHG6WATR39X_3144,Although this is a fragmented script. I understand it had been Changed at least twice. But lets face it any 40's movie with Cary Grant is a 5  star,5
